"i just needed to vent. i have been relatively fine (by which i mean not actively planning, although have had issues with eds and sh) since my suicide attempt when i was 16 just over two years ago. i was sorting through all my books to move them to another book case and a little flashcard fell out of one, which turns out to be a suicide note i wrote to my girlfriend (now ex) a couple weeks before i attempted.it completely stopped me in my tracks. after just staring at it, i had to get up and turn off my music. i have just been staring into space for the last 20 minutes.do not get me wrong, this is not triggering me into wanting to commit again, in fact quite the opposite, but i feel emotionally broken. i had already found some other triggering items from the same time period but this was just too muchthe worst thing is that i do not even remember writing it - i had no idea this existed until now. its short; only a few sentences long as i clearly did not know what to say. it just breaks my heart that i was in that place mentally, and i can genuinely hand-on-heart say that i am glad my attempt did not work. not because life is easy now, but because the balance has shifted to more good days than bad (through a shit ton of hard work, meds and therapy). and it is worth that fight even despite feeling hopeless at the time. idek if this belongs here, but i just needed to talk to someone. sending well wishes to anyone who may be reading this. just found my suicide note from 2 years ago",Suicidal,293

"i am a 20 year old female and have recently been diagnosed with major depression and social anxiety (?) but for context, i have not had the best encounters with people in the past because of my awkwardness, my rbf, or bluntness. obv none of this is intentional but sometimes people just really do not like me and alot of ppl from my middle school thought i was a loser/awkward for no reason even when i encountered a few of them in late high school. a lot of ppl on xc team also made fun of me and thought i was awkward and even my closest friends told me i used to be a 7/8 out of 10 on the awkwardness scale. i know they do not mean harm but it just hurts so much when people tell me they think i am a robot or stiff or awkward and it further discourages me and puts me into a bad mood. i do not like the way i am and it seems like other people do not either i have messed up so many times its like clockwork and i am addicted to the pain. i want to self sabotage and hurt myself but i have no idea why. i know no one here is supposed to be a therapist but i wanted to hear from other people if they had similar experiences like i do and maybe provide some insight. thanks!! why do i want people to hate me",Depression,250

since i was a teenager i have always experienced depressive episodes. i did not know what they were until my late teens/early 20s when i started feeling suicidal and made a few attempts on my life. i have used drugs and alcohol to cope for many years(not to the point of being considered an addict) but those are only temporary fixes. i have seen professionals and have been medicated but i never feel comfortable enough to discuss my true feelings and lack the ability to verbalize many of my thoughts. i am doing better in life than i was a few years ago but recently i have found myself unable to do many things i have always loved (cannot watch movies or listen to music like i used. ill sit in the dark and look at my phone for hours). it has also affected my professional growth as i am unable to make the time to learn new skills or work a little harder than i usually do. my self-esteem is pretty shot and i have self depreciating thoughts constantly. at this point i am afraid ill never be happy again. mental health,Depression,193

"post manic decisions - how to love yourself after mania man, this month has been really rough will self realizations. i don't know if any of you can relate. after being super manic for a few months and then having some mixed episodes it left me in the worst depression i've ever experienced this month. i've been spending a lot of time in bed and not leaving the house, sleeping a lot, suicidal (but not acting on it) basically depressed af. 

anyway, my mind recently started having flash backs to stupid decisions and things i've don't while i've been manic. this isn't just the most recent manic episode - it's flashbacks from my entire life. i did some not so great things, made some not so great choices and went through some traumatic shit. i keep trying to meditate or do breathing exercises to let the thoughts pass. anyway it's not going well- it's pretty much been mental torture. physically, it makes me cry out of nowhere, have panic attacks, crazy sleep patterns, throw up and some other fun stuff.

recently i've been feeling like a prisoner of my own mind just sitting here with my thoughts rotting my mind. it feels like my mind is trying to torture me and my body is trying everything it can do to survive. i'm stuck in mental illness purgatory. 

i've been trying to hang in there. any healthy suggestions to try to make peace with the fucked things i've done while manic? i'm always too hard on myself but some days my brain feels like it's taking over my body and i'm not driving this human vehicle anymore. the thoughts and visualizations of the past have just been haunting me.

""it was the non-depressed students who made the systematic errors in grossly over-estimating their control when the event had a good outcome {when they actually} had no control over it. and non-depressants underestimated their control when the event had a negative outcome.""alloy and abramson found that people suffering the doldrums proved most accurate in making judgments about themselves and less keen at sizing up other people, whom they saw in unrealistically optimistic terms -- just the opposite of how normal people see things.""it appears depressed people might be suffering from an absence of the positive bias and illusions that normal and nondepressed people tend to have,"" says alloy.

i just realized that i'm 2 years older than her and i'm about to repeat my last year of highschool (i dropped out this mid school year because of mental health reasons), and i still don't even know wtf i wanna do in life. 

my best friend is so fckin smart, she's studying right now to be a chemical engineer. my other best friend is also smart, all of his grade averages are 95+ (100 is the highest in my country). 

i'm surrounded by smart, and talented people with a future, people who will make a name for themselves and become rich in the future. people who have already carved their paths. while i'm here barely even making it through the day. i can't even go to school without wanting to off myself, while they're here working their ass off for their future.

my best friends don't even know i already dropped out of high school. i'm too embarrassed to tell them. how can i tell them? they would be too embarrassed to have a highschool dropout as a friend. what am i even doing with my life? i always avoid things, things that make me feel uncomfy or unsafe. now look where that got me. stuck inside the house wasting my life away. i'm gonna be 20 in october, my teen years are finally over. i didn't even get to experience the things that teenagers are ""supposed"" to experience. i can't believe smart people like my friends are friends with someone as pathetic as me.",Personality disorder,345

"talking to my mom today, and she says, i do not drink because when you were little i had to watch you, which i just silently agreed to, when in my head i am thinking it would have probably been better for you to just be drunk rather than what you actually did you dumb bitch because what she used to do is leave 3-4 year old me basically alone in the house because on a regular basis she would lock her bedroom door and take long naps. what kind of irresponsible and neglectful parent does that shit. and she thinks i am too stupid too remember that. like i could have drank liquor and bleach or burned the damn house down. and yeah let us not forget the time my mom violently beat down the door in a fit of rage where my dad had to take me and we had to hide in the closet and the police had to show up. which my dad did not press charges, which would have in the long run prevented her from getting custody over me preventing mountains of more abuse. i do not resent my father for that though. hes just too forgiving like that. there is other things my mother did that i was too young to remember in which the only person with guts enough to tell m is my grandpa, who is one of the few reasons i have not offed myself yet. every time i was slapped, punched, kicked, even slammed into the wall. every time i was verbally abused, every time i was neglected. child abuse is something that becomes imbedded into you. it forever changes you. i have some form of ptsd, one of the therapists told me. i remember one instance my mother tried to kick me. this time i had enough i grabbed her leg mid kick, immediately her expression changed, i twisted it, she said stop, almost crying. i was livid, almost overtaken with the thought of revenge. i asked her in a deep angry tone, do you want me throw your sorry ass on the floor? i realized in a moment of clarity that id probably be locked in a jail cell if i did that. i stopped what i was doing. felt guilt. was i wrong? was i right? ill never know. just as ill never know who i would have been without a psychotic abusive parent. abuse",Suicidal,409

i'm looking into other things, such as lyme (which actually could be a possibility) but was wondering if anyone else had a case of a longer withdrawal time with lamictal, or something that you thought was harder than you might have thought in the first place?  or just any thoughts?  it's really dragging me down.  i'd really appreciate it, and hope that everyone is feeling well!

i've been taking lamictal for a while, but recently stopped taking it because i kept forgetting about it (i know, very bad. i'm back on it now). i've also been on vyvanse/other adhd meds like adderal for a while as well. apparently i've been manic recently according to my pdoc, which isn't surprising, so she took me off of vyvanse for the next month until i get my bipolar back in check. she said that stimulants like vyvanse can influence manic bipolar.

"i got an aneurysm and i'm still alive i feel the need to add a trigger warning to this post. as someone who suffers from ha, i know this post can be scary but if i can be positive about it, you all can! i was diagnosed with brain aneurysm and artery dissections when i was 22, which put me at stroke risk until i was fully healed (which i am now). i will post the full story in the comments.

it seems that for some of you on here, that is literally your worst fear, i'm here to tell you that even if it does happen, an aneurysm or even a stroke is not a death sentence. in fact, i was healed (with no surgery) within 3 months.  the aneurysm had been there for at least 2 months before that and i had no idea, and i still lived! the most debilitating part of this? the ha i got from it. it was the darkest 6 months of my life. i was in constant fear of having a stroke despite the blood thinners i was on. i never wanted to be alone anywhere and only felt truly safe with my parents. i had panic attacks all the time. but slowly, i gained more confidence in the functioning abilities of my body. i can honestly say that the ha affected me way more than the neurological symptoms did. so give your bodies more credit and your anxious brains less credit! 

if i can survive an aneurysm and torn artery and only have bits of ha after 2 years, so can you!!

"meds and memory hi everyone, i'm new to this forum, and was diagnosed with bp2 less than a year ago. i'm on a medicine regimen that is working really well for my mood, however my body has adjusted to it and my memory attention and focus are still no where near where they were pre-treatment. which i'm a biochem student and i have finals in less than two months so this isn't ideal. 


currently im on 100mg seroquel (i don't think this is effecting my memory very much, it's the first thing the started me on, tbh if it is this id rather have the sleep)

and 100mg lamictal (i'm pretty sure this is the culprit, but idk if stopping it and trying to find something else while school is on session would be safer or riskier in terms of cognative abilities)

they had me on buspar but i stopped taking that within a few weeks of school starting because it was just impossible. and stopping that helped a lot and then he raised my lamictal and it's still better than it was but not where it needs to be.
i'd really rather not take amphetamines, but if anyone has had similar problems with these or could suggest something that's helped them so i could do some research and bring it up with my doc in a few weeks thatd be wonderful.

---also side note i think the lamictal was making me anemic so i doubled up on my iron and b vitamins, so im not sure it might still be due to some level of anemia",Bipolar,267
"the only things my mom can do is provide with the bare minimum which are food, shelter and etc. other than that she is just terrible, and maybe sometimes she is nice when she is not screaming at me for nothing. i would say she is toxic because she always compares me to others including herself, she is a massive hypocrite who gets mad at me when i do the exact same thing as her, shr hit me as a child and also once when i was 12 byt that is a different story, she cursed at me as a child, she even fighted with her own mom and also with her dad for like half a year after we moved with him and even though she knows i have trouble with selfharm and that i am suicidal (because the psychiatrist had to tell her) she did not change a bit. still yelling at me for little things and because of one of our daily fights i relapsed after i tried so hard to resist the urges. and i am writing this post right after one of our big fights where i *again* told her that she is not a good mom and that she is not self aware at all. in the end i told her that i did not want the psychiatrist to tell her because i do not trust her, i did not want to tell her that i think i have ocd because i do not trust her, i told her about my almost suicide attempt and that it was right after one of our massive fights, and after all that she says that there is still more life to live, so i am just done. i want to cut so bad right now but i do not want to use a knife again, i want to use a sharo blade but i cannot get one. she is also one of the people that thinks that a positive mindset will make everything better. well mom, it is kind of hatd to get my grades up when i gave up on school and life. i hate my mom",Suicidal,361

"ha with starting new medications a few years ago, i was placed on a mood stabilizer to treat bpd and the first night that i took it i got extremely dizzy, my heart rate spiked, and i spent the next two days in bed unable to think straight because everything was just fuzzy and i couldn't concentrate or find the energy to function.

ever since, i've been *petrified* of starting new medications. a few times now, my psychiatrist has put me on something and i didn't even start taking it because i would take to the internet to double-check possible side effects and suddenly become too afraid to. i always worry starting something new, wondering if this one will have another frightening effect, if i'll have an allergic reaction, if it'll interfere with my heart condition, etc - basically, i always end up terrified to start taking something, because i'm convinced it will be dangerous, or at least will make me feel worse than whatever it's treating.

today, after seeing my psychiatrist again, i've been given a new prescription, this time for strattera to treat the adhd i just got diagnosed with very recently. strattera is the only/safest option for me right now, as stimulants definitely will aggravate my heart condition. but so many people online (i peeked around /r/adhd and a few other places) say it made them feel absolutely horrible, with more side effects than benefits, and now i'm back to being terrified to take it.

"bipolar disorder and incurable stds hi, i hope this is allowed here. wasn't sure if i should post it here or somewhere else. it's kinda really hard to post this. 

so, i have bipolar mania. i haven't received treatment for it in years. i would love to eventually get treatment.  i also am pretty sure i have an incurable std.  (not asking for any diagnoses or anything.) 

is it okay to ask if anybody else does too? i have this very strong feeling i'm not good enough to have friends or relationships because of all these things. ie to keep people safe away from me/no one wants to be around someone like that probably. this makes it easier when i'm having a depressive episode to push everyone away without thinking i'm doing so. i feel like just the thought makes my depressive episodes worse.

"anxiety after seeing dog having seizure back in january my 3 year old lab mix had what we think was a mild seizure. we took him to the vet the next day. blood work came back normal so all we can really do is see if it happens again. thankfully it hasn't happened again but we don't know for sure.

but i don't want to see it happen again. this dog is my whole world, my best friend. he's the best thing that's ever happened to me. i've always had anxiety but after seeing that happen to him it's gotten worse. i hate seeing him suffer.

there are days where i don't want to leave the house in case anything happens to him. there are days where i hardly eat or drink anything because i'm so anxious.

i don't know how to move on. if it happens again i don't know how i will cope. i want my boy to live a long happy life.",Anxiety,165

an added unwanted effect is that this makes me come across as flaky, disorganized, or unreliable -- and i'm not saying i'm definitively not those things. bums me out, though. i can use a calendar app, i swear. i just do not know how i'll be feeling a month from now. and a bunch of my friends are very ""type a,"" so it sort of compounds the issue because they love having full calendars and planning hangs weeks in advance.

so this past weekend i went to a college reunion with people i hadn't seen in 7 years. we went out one night and a friend asked if i smoked, i said no. he handed me his vape and said try this. i did, and hit it a few more times through out the night. 

well at the end of the reunion weekend he revealed to a friend that he had been hiv+ for several years and currently has his virus controlled and undetectable.

(it also feels like time is zooming by sometimes but idk if that is just me).those are the major ones to list a few more; i am warm and sweaty all the time, social interactions feel bizarrely different, i have gone from being super insecure to not being able to get away from a mirror, dehydrated easier and i guess that is it off the top of my head.i am just curious; what subsides and what stays? i understand wellbutrin is not a miracle pill and its more of a trade one big problem for a little less significant and easier to deal with problems. also if anyone wants to chat about it or are currently in the same spot with their treatment/are looking for support, id be happy to support and could also use some. thanks ! wellbutrin 150mg - 300mg change",Depression,493

i've had my official diagnose; low-functioning avpd. i don't exactly know how to feel about it, it makes sense - all too much sense. i wonder if i could've turned out better if i had been diagnosed earlier, since i've basically wasted my entire life so far. only good part was some part of my 0-9'th grade, since it was a private school that had good experience with a bit different kids (not a special-school, but nevertheless a good school for me).

well, looking forward at least i have this diagnosis now, and i have somewhere to start from. i'll be looking to get my doctor's reference to a psychologist, to hopefully make some progress with all of this. even though i'm a complete hermit, who is not at all good at getting daily things done, i do have at least a bit of hope of turning some things around - i still have hope that i can make progress for the better. but it's going to be hard.

"i am about to turn 18 and i am not ready. i never planned on getting this far, living this long. that selfish desire to end it all is still there but i am too afraid to do it. i look back at 15 year old me, feeling almost the exact same way, and wish i would had the guts to do it then. if i had not taken years to dwell on it, years in which i have acheived absolutely nothing, done absolutely nothing, i might have been able to rest and find peace so much sooner. i felt like i have not slept in years, my relationship with food is only more horrendous and the only thing that forces me outside is an exercise addiction. whatever momentary happiness i might feel when i watch a good film, or see a fox in the evening, does not make any of this worth it. i have not felt true joy in so long, i do not think i even remember what it means to actually enjoy life.i have completely wasted my teenage years. i have spent them inside for the most part, isolating myself from people and trying to sort myself out on my own. i cut people off, and other people got bored and left, and now my only good friends live thousands of miles away and i will probably never even get to meet them. i know this is my fault, and i should have tried harder to connect with people, but i just could not. it felt impossible to hold onto those who mattered. now i watch them all, on instagram, going about their lives and having a great time, and i am so happy for them, but i am also so selfishly jealous. that happiness they have is all i have ever wanted. if i could throw away everything i have, but be free from mental illness, i would do it in a heartbeat. i am so exhausted. i do not even know what i am doing anymore. i am about to turn 18 and i have wasted my teenage years",Depression,355

"anxiety around smelling bad it's been 3 days but i have been super paranoid about this.

my friend and i were hanging out and i don't remember how it was necessarily brought up but she said ""i know a girl who is very pretty but she doesn't shower"" and then asked ""do you think she knows"" after i told her idk it depends cause for some people they do and others they don't then she asked ""btw how often do you shower?""

i've beeb freaking out ever since then that she was throwing a hint that i don't stink but i have asked two people i trust that same day if i stink and they said no but what she said was too odd and random for it to not be a hint although she did ask me for a hug before leaving after the whole thing happened so maybe it wasn't about me?

"ways to help until i can get on meds? hi! i'm a freshman in college who's had a long history of mental health. i had to drop out of school last year after i was hospitalized for a suicide attempt. my doctor said it was ""anxiety"" and basically send me to cbt and told me to get back to school. i've always had ""ups and downs"" where for a couple of days i feel like i'm on top of the world and can run 5 miles easily. i can study without distraction and can get my work done. other days, i'm too exhausted to get out of bed and i easily snap at people. i can barley do the things i love, like read my book or play my xbox. my mom has been insistent that i have bipolar disorder (she's kept a notebook with all my up and down behavior and notices a pattern). i can't get a psychologist until may since the university ones refuse to take me until next semester. is there anything i can do to lessen the symptoms until i get on the meds?

the first guy ""dave"" i met when i was 19 on vacation. he and i would just talk at the pool about politics and education (even though he was kind of a party guy, he has a nerdy side). we only hung out for two days, but after our first day hanging out, the second day, he was really shy talking to me. but our romance was cut short because he had a girlfriend, and made the mistake of spilling the beans about his crush on me to other kids at the resort. he cut off contact with me, but when they broke up a month later, he started looking at my social media a lot. not to mention, he made a playlist about me for my birthday. we don't even talk, so i don't know if this is some sort of peace offering or apology. 

the second guy ""steve"" i met a year later, at my job. he and i bonded on the first day of work about growing up in the same hometown, and i told my mom that day about how we bonded over our ""parallel lives"". we worked together for a little over a year. and we never went out or anything, but he would hit on me a lot. but stupid me was either too dense to realize he was flirting or too surprised in the moment to say any good flirting lines back. but a customer asked me for my number one day, and i gave it to him. i guess i kind of wanted to motivate my crush to ask me out, but literally the week after, he went out with his sister's friend (the sister set them up), but they broke up and he likes me.

"how to get motivated to workout when depressed? basically what it says in the title.

in theory, i know exercise helps with symptoms, and i like going to the gym when i'm not in the depths of depression. however, when i'm depressed, it's nearly impossible for me to motivate myself to go even semi-consistently. i get stuck doing nothing. i have trouble getting myself to put my gym clothes on, let alone actually walking there and completing a workout.

also, i don't experience much, if any, of the usual pleasure i get after i work out (normally i'd feel better afterwards) when i'm depressed, so it's pretty hard to convince myself to do it because ""i'll feel better later"".

i've tried going for longer walks and other stuff, but if i'm honest dragging myself around my city in the rain alone with my dark thoughts doesn't help much. i go out most days with my dog, but when it gets bad i can't even begin to face it.

i know i sound like i'm being lazy and dramatic, but i'm serious. i really can't stand the idea of getting up, putting on my clothes, putting on my shoes, getting my dog ready, finding my keys, finding my phone, putting on my coat, locking up, going down the stairs in my apartment building, walking for 40 minutes, climbing the stairs again, then unlocking my door and going in. i get stuck between steps and find myself outside alone in the cold too sad to walk home, or staring at the stairs (pun) in my building unable to drag myself up them.

i get psychomotor slowing when i'm really bad.  it's physically difficult to walk. it feels like my body is made of lead. sometimes it takes me over an hour to complete an activity that would normally take me half that time.

for people who've been able to push through this and get themselves to exercise, how?",Bipolar,326

"i've been worrying about aneurysms since last night and its been a really rough time. how do i get past this? hey everyone, i'm so glad that subreddit exists because it's so comforting to know that i'm not the only one who struggles with this type of anxiety (since i was a little girl).

recently though, i have been really sick - like since before thanksgiving. i've had bronchitis, the norovirus (ended up in hospital), tonsillitis, the flu, then the stomach flu again, and now i'm at home sick for a week because the cold i've had since early november never went away and it has turned into walking pneumonia and strep throat. my throat is covered in huge white blisters and it's just so disgusting.

but anyways, i was put on a really high antibiotic and prednisone 3x a day, and it's just made me feel anxious and so strange. i started feeling like my pulse in my groin and it really freaked me out, so i googled (i want to punch myself lol) and the first thing that came up was aneurysm. then my husband told me it was probably the steroid making my nerves jittery, so i googled again (i rly need to stop) and it said that some people have experienced something called ""phantom vibrations"" or something like that. the thing is though, i'm pretty sure this has happened to me before and i've never paid it any attention.

i had a rly bad panic attack right after that, but i took a shower and calmed down and was fine. but today, my hip and leg have been aching, and i'm not sure if it's my fibromyalgia acting up bc i'm sick or if it's just a psychosomatic symptom or even possibly the prednisone  making me feel this way.

has anyone else ever experienced this? because i know it's probably nothing, but i've just had a rough time today with being worried about it and having the thought of aneurysm in the back of my brain.

"lurker realizing i need some help coping/understanding depressive episode relapse. i guess for some preface i was diagnosed last year but have had it all my life. i'm type 1 but was pretty functional as i typically used what i now realize is my mania in school and etc. and pretty much was excelling despite going through manic and depressive episodes (thinking it was normal/teenage angst etc.) until about my 4th year in college when things went down south fast. fast forward two years, a couple of hospital visits, and finally getting a full wrap around team, i'm a lot more stable now that i'm on what i feel are the right set of meds for me atm (been on a set of lithium, lorazepram, and buproprion for the past 3 months and it's worked amazingly). it's allowed me to work, write, and just generally focus like i used to without the mood swings and recognize when i'm becoming manic or depressed at high caliber level that i'm used to. i know that the meds aren't a cure all and that relapse happens, but recently have had a string of events (good, bad, and otherwise) have caused my depression to come back in full swing. i recognize it for what it is and why i feel like this, which is a huge step compared to before, but it's just as heavy and still rather difficult to deal with unlike my mania where i  know just to tune it down. i don't really know what i'm looking for in this as i have a pretty solid support system, but i guess if anyone else has had relapse experiences post medication i think hearing about others dealt with hearing about it would be helpful. because i'm really in a spot where im really not sure how to approach it and could probably use some netflix/movie suggestions as i don't have much energy to do anything else. thanks for reading and sorry if this is all over the place.

you know i sometimes take a blade to my hand but i get scared. i get terrified, that probably is a primal instinct. that definitely means i am faking it all, right. if i really hated myself and wanted to kms, i'd be able to sink it deeper, with no regards to the pain. but noooo, all i can do is barely see the white.  because if i was really wanted to kms, i'd have something to show for it. if i'm really suffering, i should've been able to cut deeper just to deal with the ""emotional pain"" that i apparently have. but wait, i can't slide-and-dice deeper - if everything in my life is all fine and dandy, yeah that's right. i'm a fraud. i can't, so that clearly shows i'm not in pain. can't even get a drop out. i'm a fucking fraud

"paxil withdrawal induced hypomania/rapid cycle i f**ed up my life in just 2 weeks.

my brief history:

* fall 2014 was prescribed paxil 20mg/day for mild depression, anxiety and hypochondria. 
* tapered from 20mg to 10mg in 6 month.
* i was on 10mg since june 2015 till august 2017. so: 2 years, 10mg daily. i always took medicine before go sleep.
* i tapered from 10mg/day to 2.5mg/day in 5-7 months (august 2017 ~ march 2018)
* i stopped to take medication 2 weeks ago (20 of march).

until this point i was totally fine. 

now detailed description of last 2 weeks:

* first 5 days were totally fine
* on day 6 (30 march) first withdrawals symptoms kicked in: shivering, cold, severe insomnia
* on day 12 (1 april) withdrawals was unbearable, experience first manic/depressive episode. decided to reinstate on 5mg(and later 10mg)/day. i took my first half pill midday.
* day 13 (2 april): 5mg morning, 5mg evening
* day 14 (3 april): 5mg morning, 0mg evening
* day 15 (4 april): 5mg morning, 5mg evening
* day 16 (today, 5 april): 5 mg morning

the symptoms i have now are rather painful and hardly bearable. most prominent are: rapid cycling from depressive episodes(+moredate agitation and anxiety) to hypomanic episodes and severe insomnia. cycles changing every few hours and quite intensive! i never had this before, never!! now i'm totally off, confused, suicidal, haven't slept cople nights. i'm in  hypomanic episode right now so i can write this post. i took sick leave at my work, but if this will continue i will lose my job completely. i beg you for advice on how i can stabilize now, based on what i've already done. i'm not even looking to weaning off meds now, as there are a lot of life circumstances now that i responsible for. i just want to stabilize and reduce pain.
what i can do at this point? it's do hard to believe i broke my brain beyond repair so rapidly, just in 2 weeks. i was normal, happy and fully of life. now i'm anxious, agitated and depress vegetable, lying on the coach wanting to die/suicide.
any advice highly appreciated.

p.s. yes, i visited my gp,  he put me on a waiting list to mental illness clinic (waiting time ~4 weeks) and advised to continue paroxetine 10mg/day for 2 weeks and then increase to 20mg/day if needed. but i'm scared to follow this advice",Bipolar,411

i have been thinking i am a complete waist of space lately cannot find a job that pays well i have no prospects at all. i do not want to just be another cog in the machine. am tired of this world and its inequality. i cannot make ends meet debt just keeps mounting up i have to juggle what bills to pay from one month to the next. am 32 and if i have got another 40 years of this shit to put up with i do not want it. i was also just hanging on from having a mental breakdown so i went and done a long distance walk. i came back and slowly started to become depressed again. i met a woman and even tho i only seen her for 4 weeks i loved her from the moment i saw her dove right in feet first. total fool that i am. we had the smallest of fallouts and i have been given a two week break to better myself. but all its done is bring everything i previously thought about myself to the surface again. so the doctor prescribed me prozac. i really thought it would stop me crying and feeling sorry for myself. but i have reached a point today i have started looking for the best way to end it. how the hell i still feel anything after starting these tablets is beyond me i literally cannot stop crying and am on prozac i thought this would have numbed my feelings but i have cried since sunday last week.,Suicidal,264
all my friends are in jail and i'm thinking of crashing out im in a certain blood set and most of my friends are in jail. i myself was thinking of going to jail too. i don't value myself. i joined the set because i was protecting someone close to me from another gang because they threatened to hurt them. i'm going to accept the consequences if i carry out the mission on my own but it does suck. my best friends are gone possibly forever. my day ones. i still have a couple around but it's not the same you know. no female can replace a bond between my friend group. they were my niggas lol but yeah i'm only 18 and kinda willing to throw my life away already. my heart feels so cold everyday. from drug addiction to doing shit in the streets. from being abandoned at a young age to being homeless with my family. from people always looking down on me and the darkness i surrounded myself with. i despise humans besides my best friends and my family. i hate people. i'm ready to go i really don't care if i live or die. it's crazy because even my therapist told me at a young age i'd be a threat to society anyways. i'd be afraid to admit she was right. materialistic things don't matter to me. i feel as if almost my only purpose is living for my gang. i don't feel happy ever. i just hate everyone and everything. i'm ready to go. i miss my friends. goodbye.,Depression,265

(probably.)

an added unwanted effect is that this makes me come across as flaky, disorganized, or unreliable -- and i'm not saying i'm definitively not those things. bums me out, though. i can use a calendar app, i swear. i just do not know how i'll be feeling a month from now. and a bunch of my friends are very ""type a,"" so it sort of compounds the issue because they love having full calendars and planning hangs weeks in advance.

anyway, i think i'll buy tickets to this thing even if i don't end up being able to go. it's just annoying i have to incorporate this into my decision-making. i can barely rsvp to weddings with any degree of confidence. that's all. thanks.

"(i have not been diagnosed with any depressive disorders but have speculations)since september last year (2020) i have just minimally replied to my friends that were in another college whilst i was in sixth form. i have just became super antisocial and anxious after a break up in july (2020).today one of them asked me how i was doing and i decided to reply after ignoring the message for a month. i told them that i was depressed and anxious as hell. although i was honest, i thought i would feel better but i do not.what is wrong with me?they showed their support, saying they are there if i wanted to talk and when i am ready. i basically feel the same, a little bit uneasy.too long did not read: after months of isolation from my friends, ignoring messages and minimally replying, i finally replied today - saying i was depressed and anxious lately, i thought something would change like a feeling, feeling better. but nothing did, i still feel lonely and uneasy. what is this and what do i do? i contacted my friends after months of ignoring them",Depression,190
"more trouble than i'm worth without going into much detail, here's a little context:
happily (as much as bpd allows) married to a wonderful man, and we have a beautiful, brilliant toddler. they're so good to/for me - i often feel undeserving. 
i've been in a depressive episode for almost 2 months - med compliant, have been for 3 years. 

lately, i've been fucking up little, typical people things; scratched the car, got scammed out of $300, letting food go bad in the fridge... they're hitting my self-worth hard for no other reason than my low threshold for disappointment and my high expectations of myself. 

the latest thing is a creepy message left on my front door on valentine's day saying they saw me in the area and wanted to leave their number/facebook in case they never saw me again.... wtf. of course my husband is pissed, and i feel like my privacy has been 100% violated. husband is so upset that he has a hard time seeing how this affects me - but besides that, i feel like i'm way more trouble than i'm worth. 
my constant emotional turmoil, the fatigue, prescription drug costs, migraines that make me worthless for hours. 
i feel like i should just be alone. like the people i love shouldn't be subjected to my bullshit and have to clean up my messes or pay my debt when i die (just got denied life insurance for bpd diagnosis). 
i have a lot of supportive people in my life, family, friends, therapist. regardless, i can't shake this worthlessness, self-loathing guilt. 

thanks for reading if you do, just having a rough... life right now. i know this probably sounds whiny - i have an objectively great life that i've worked hard for. why do i still feel so shitty? ",Bipolar,302

"hello, new here hello everyone, lurker for a small while now. i'm 24m.

i'm in the process of getting diagnosed, cause my life is shit and i continually fail at anything and have no friends and never had a romantic relationship. everything points to avpd according to the psychiatric place i'm being diagnosed in, so i figured i'd check out the sub some time ago. i resonate with a lot of people in here, so i felt like i'd chip in a bit.

i've essentially lived in complete isolation for 3-4 months now except to buy groceries (on sick leave from my vocational school), only very rarely seeing family in that time. all social interaction is through online games (not that this has ever really been much different), which i do think help ground me a bit more in reality. i know that some of you guys have gone years without even that, and i'm sorry to hear it. i want to get better, finish my education, have one or two friends, a roma tic relationship and a job. but life is fucking hard and most of the time it feels like a fact that none of it will ever happen, seriously fuck living like this.

i'm getting a little hope from knowing more about avpd and that i most likely am about to be diagnosed, so i can get help, but even still i've had times today where i just feel like human waste that shouldn't be allowed to exist. i'm scared of getting hurt so i've never attempted suicide, even though i've fantasized about it a lot. i also couldn't bring myself to do anything like it because of my family, sometimes they're all that holds me from crossing my fear.

anyways onto more non-death related shit, earlier i ordered food and have put a note to the delivery driver to just ring the doorbell and place it on the mat. i really hope they got the note, cause i look fucking terrible and struggle with taking regular baths. besides my apartment looks so bad i'd rather not have anyone look inside, so yeah kinda just hope to be able to pick up my food in peace.

"overstressing everything hey, joined this community just now since i kinda need some life advice, from anyone.

i've always been stressing out a lot over various things, but as of recently i started to realise that it has taken over my life in various ways. 

for example, even as of recently i was supposed to drive a group of friends to a theme park. just a fun day, but the responsibility of driving my friends there somehow made me insanely nervous, even though i was ""calm inside"" if that makes sense. as a result i slept 0 hours in total. melatonin didn't work, meditating did nothing, breathing exercises did nothing, my mind just kept on racing.  
(p.s. a friend drove in my car for me, i'm not driving on 0 hrs of sleep)

  
it's not just that single event though. school days cause stress, tests cause stress, even having a totally free day but having to receive a package the next day causes sleep issues and stomach aches.   
when doing things i'm always thinking about the worst thing that could happen, and what if that would happen, even if the chances are minimal, which only adds up to the stress.

"so this is going to be a long post but idk where else to go. i have a lot of things that are really stressing me out right now and i do not know where to even start to process any of it. back in march of this year i [m20] was diagnosed with testicular cancer, i had surgery to have the tumor removed and less good for awhile. at the same time, my mom found out she has stage 4 lung cancer and was given about 8 months to live. i had just moved into an apartment with my girlfriend [f20] of about three years and things were starting to look up for me finally. then in may my girlfriend said that she could not be in a relationship without loving herself right first and that wed have another chance after that. then four days later she was telling a coworker how much she liked him. and we still live together because were under a lease contract and we have puppies together, we had started a life together. every weekend she goes over to that other guys house and spends days there. now i come to find out my cancer is back in the middle of all this. its in my lymph nodes and i have to do some chemo. the doctors and nurses say that i should not be alone because of possible side effects. so my ex says that she will be home as mush as she can besides being away for work of course. but instead of sticking to what she said, she goes to that guys house all the time. and as of writing this i have been alone for 3 days. and she said the other day that i need to move out once my chemo is done. but i do not have anywhere to go, i cannot afford an apartment of my own. none of my friends have room. the only place i know i could go is back to my moms but the reason i moved out is because she gets drunk and emotionally abusive. i also need a place where i can have my dog because i do not want to leave him behind. all of this stuff piling up has made me depressed and suicidal, and i have tried to kill myself about 3 times since may but i always chicken out. i have been considering cancelling my chemo and just letting the cancer do its thing so that way people can say goodbye and it hopefully will not be as much of a big shock on people. but i genuinely do not feel like i want to be on this earth anymore and i do not know what to do. any advice at all would be so helpful! can anyone offer some advice?",Depression,474

over the last few months my anxiety has become debilitating! even with my medication (trileptal and seriquil) im to the point were i can be walking down the street and get the image in my head of a car swerving and hitting my on the side walk. this thought gets glued in my head and i am scared to walk down the street. yesterday i was dozing on the couch and my 5 year old laid their tablet on my chest. the power cord stretched across my neck and i woke screaming with the image stuck in my head of being strangled by a power cord. its as if i live in red alert. loud noises, sudden movements, crowded rooms, new unfamiliar settings, traffic...i try my best to avoid it all but the isolation is becoming severe. this is happening more and more frequently. im honestly scared. 

ive tried discussing with my wife but she dosnt get it. she is so task oriented that any free time we have is used to discuss, analyze, dissect, reanalyze, plan, replan, budget, etc for all of the major upcoming moves we have. this serves as a constant reminder of how overwhelmed i am. im drinking to much to sleep and try to temporarily check out.  but its killing me and im ready to give up. im seriously considering checking myself into a hospital. but i will loose my job and it will throw a wrench into all the plans we have been making for the last year.

"pot induced my mania, is this the new normal? is bipolar mania precipitated by marijuana use typically one off, or a ""new normal"" in the cycle?  am i likely to experience full-blown mania without medication?

some background:

after a period of minor depression i reverted to old habits and smoked some marijuana which caused my first manic episode.  i spent some time in a psych ward and was given lithium and zyprexa, which didn't fully suppress my manic state.  after a couple months in hypomania, i gave my zyprexa to someone else i'd med who couldn't afford them.  i thought i'd be fine, with just a week until my next refill.  i was wrong, and went manic, totalled my car, and ended up back in the psych ward.  now i'm dealing with the fallout from this event.

i'm 26, and generally high functioning.  i was an alcoholic for a few years and have been sober for about 4 years (it runs in my family).  i'd smoked pot before, but not often because it would make me feel very anxious and make my thoughts race.

is this extreme episode of mania my new normal or is it likely a one-off ?  i'd never experienced them before.  in fact, i don't think i'd ever really experienced general hypomania before, only excitement related to specific projects or areas of interest.

i'm unable to find much online about this, here's one:

&gt;clinicians agree that cannabis use can cause acute adverse mental effects that mimic psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

&gt;[...]

&gt;cannabis abuse prior to development of bipolar disorder has a significant effect on first-episode mania and on the course of the disease. another study reported that using cannabis at baseline can significantly increase the risk for manic symptoms during follow up.

"a year ago i moved from san angelo tx to austin tx. i felt off, and not at home. but i pushed through and got a car, i even paid it off. unfortunately my year was up and i moved to lubbock. i had suicidal thoughts, i have never had thoughts like that and it scared me so i went to a psychiatric hospital. they diagnosed me with major depressive disorder. it all started with a simple thought is life about working your whole life so you can support yourself. i moved back to san angelo tx thinking i could get a grasp of what home felt like. i try to do things but i end up just wanting to go home. having a job with depression is so hard, i always quit, i am not motivated, i do not have self esteem. its weird how i woke up one day and the color in the world was dimmed. i do not want to be here anymore. major depressive disorder",Depression,170
her wedding is next month and is planning on inviting over 100 people including cousins she never met. when the invitations came my parents were invited but not me. they called her up and asked why i was not invited. she went silent and finally after badgering her for an answer she said i was an autistic loser and her wedding was for cool people only. then she called me the r word and said she did not want people like me ruining the happiest day of her life. i do not know what i ever did to her. i know i am socially awkward and cannot hold conversations very well. that is no reason to exclude someone. i am so upset. she stopped talking to me years ago when she got popular in school. my family thought she would grow out of it when she got older but it never happened my (33/m) sister (30/f) invited everyone to her wedding except me,Depression,163

"anyone else from a minority community, nationality, ethnic group, religion, or race and feel like an outcast everywhere? apart from moving many times during childhood and teenage years i have one parent who was jewish and one who was hispanic/puerto rican. they divorced when i was young (stevie wonder could see that one coming) and as a result i never felt like i belonged with any community. i never learned spanish, never really learned all that much about being jewish or puerto rican (my mother was americanized) except the basic stuff. i was also too isolated to feel like a belonged to the average american culture in general and never really picked up on all the pop-culture that went along with it. i've always felt like an outcast and outsider partly because of this. although at the same time i feel like i'm a failure/coward because i see many people who are part of a minority group who are able to handle themselves just fine and i'm white on top of that so i didn't really have it that hard. you can tell i may be jewish because of some of my facial features (lol) and i was sometimes teased and bullied in school/work because of it but it's never been as bad as someone who is for example dark skinned (in a western country) and has a foreign accent. even then i feel people like that had their own community to fall back to though and i feel lost almost. idk, forgive my rambling... just want to put this out there and wondering if others are the same way.

"i am just curious how different the feeling is for everyone. for me i could best describe it as a heavy black cloud. no matter what you do your stuck in this cloud. it makes hanging out with friends, and being all alone in your bed feel the same. it makes the world look black. your thoughts are all negative. you instinctively hate yourself, because you do not do anything. because you cannot do anything. because doing something feels the same as doing nothing. it makes everything horribly repetitive. because the feeling is stronger than any one thing you experience in your day. no matter what you do in your day, the depression will always stand out amongst everything else. your numb to everything. it makes getting out of bed difficult. it makes thinking difficult. it makes existing difficult.how does it feel for everyone else? i feel anyone who does not have it, really cannot understand it. because it is not just feeling low. people do not take their own life because of feeling ""low"". idk i just wish people could understand the feeling. i am honestly convinced if everyone could feel it, just for one day, all the stigma around it would be completely gone. what does it feel like?",Depression,211

the men in my family are known to have dreams or epiphanies (as best as i can describe it) of the future that most of the time come true and i am not excluded from that. it can vary from how a particular day turns out to if your girlfriend is going to be unfaithful. usually the vision will come before the signs that something will happen do. i have been having a recurring dream of my eventual suicide. i can see the path the bullet will take through my brain and it used to not bother me i was completely ok with it. i embraced it even because knowing i would not live long anyway made everything so much easier. i had another wave of calm the other day and i knew then that this was the final stop. i can either continue working my dead end job living at home with no friends anymore and kill myself in six months time or i could hang on to the last bit of hope that maybe i can turn myself around. i got up and decided fuck it i am already dead inside what more could hurt me and i trimmed my beard and brushed my teeth. yesterday i cleaned my room (kind of) and today i actually got to work on time. today i applied for another job and i am trying to do at least one little thing of self care every day. maybe one day ill climb out of this void. funny thing is the main thing that bothered me about seeing my gravesite in a daydream is that they put a headstone and i have specifically requested that i be wrapped in a cotton sheet and a cedar tree planted at my head i do not want my body preserved. i could even see the date on it but no cedar tree more important. tldr; maybe i am not ok with suicide i know how i am (hopefully) not going to die,Depression,336

my current concern is with the brain eating amoeba. i spent time in a hot tub that wasn't properly chlorinated this weekend. shortly after the hot tub, i got in the shower and ummm.. picked my nose rather vigorously. after doing so, i thought about the warm hot tub water, so i blew my nose then used saline spray to clean out my nostrils. 2 times in the last 3 days, i've gotten really dizzy and lightheaded, feeling like i was going to fall or pass out. today, i've had a bad headache and have felt extra sensitive to light. no fever at this point. 

allow me to think out loud:
- can the amoeba even enter the brain from picking your nose?
- is it possible that the amoeba would have just been in my nostril, then i helped it further up towards the brain with the stream of saline solution?
- would a headache associated with the amoeba come and go or be constant/progressively worse?

i know a much more effecting outlet would have been distracting myself or using other anxiety relieving techniques.. but i couldn't resist venting on here. i'm struggling! i know the questions i posed are mostly unanswerable. just needed to ask them ""out loud"" rather than let them cycle internally.

"the reason i want to talk about this is because i am a *completely* different person without depression than with depression. the way i think and how i see myself is totally modified. i know this, because i experience depression in episodes, which means that on some random day i wake up and just feel normal/neutral/happy = no depression. i get a lot of blame by others for not ""focusing on the positive"" or for being mentally weak during a depressive episode, while in truth, those symptoms are all things that are directly linked to depression and it is almost *impossible* to remove them, without removing the depression.the symptoms: guilt. i would literally feel guilty for my whole existence and everything i do or am. i become the culprit, the scapegoat, the inherently wrong one... i would have this feeling all day long. whenever i am not depressed, this feeling is completely absent. low self-esteem. oh yes, that is a big one and a very obvious one. i would also not feel entitled to do certain things, because i feel like i do not deserve it. i deserve to be treated badly by others and not allowed to speak up for myself etc. it is also almost entirely absent without depression. complaining and overthinking. i often forget that this is also directly linked to my depression. i do not really have much of a reason to overthink about things in my life and then constantly complain about stuff, which i do 24/7 while depressed. i am not able to deal with and overcome the problems i have during those episodes, whereas during no-depression i have the tools, the emotional strength and the solutions to get out of difficult situations. i encourage you to add more symptoms you experience to this list. can we talk about the less obvious symptoms of depression?",Depression,311

"i think the attitude towards antidepressants that you hear from a lot of people is extremely counterproductive. it is true that antidepressants do not work for everybody and they can have very unpleasant side effects that may (or may not) even last for last for as long as you take the meds. i do not disagree with this as i have experienced some of these side effects myself.but some people act like their personal negative experience can be universally applied and try to talk people out of trying meds that they might have benefitted from. and that is not okay because everybody reacts differently to the medication so you cannot know if someone else's expierience matches yours.but the worst offender are people that do not know anything about depression or how antidepressants work and come at you with rumors and half truths to get you away from the ""bad way"" of dealing with depression. there is a big stigma against using antidepressants and it really needs to disappear.btw if antidepressants do not work for you i am not trying to invalidate your experiences. i just think it is bad to spread them like they are universal. *rant* i do not like the attitude that many people have towards antidepressants",Depression,209

"worried about my gallbladder - how to stay calm until my next ultrasound. (quick background: i've had health anxiety since my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer, and it's gone through the roof in the year &amp; a half since she died.)

a year ago my doctor discovered a small polyp on my gallbladder. it was only 3mm, but he decided to monitor it anyway just in case, which means an ultrasound every 6 months for 2 years. during my second ultrasound, the polyp was a little bigger -- this time, 4mm -- and my doctor seemed worried. but he seems like he gets worried easily, so i don't really know how i should feel... 

my mom's gallbladder was removed for a variety of reasons at 45, and it turned out hers had precancerous cells (cells that look a bit off and may develop into cancer). so my family history has me worried. i'm also concerned because (a) it's a single polyp, and single polyps are more likely to be cancerous, and (b) it's growing, albeit slowly.

i keep trying to tell myself that i'm young (mid-twenties) and that gallbladder cancer is extremely unlikely in anyone under 40, but i can't shrug this awful feeling. gallbladder cancer kills 85% of people within 5 years (though most people are diagnosed late-stage, so who knows what my odds would be if i actually had it).

there are three times when a potentially bad thing can hurt you. you can get anxious before it happens (if it happens). you can have it happen. and then you can ruminate and dwell on it. i know i can't always control what happens to me, but i do want to get better at reducing anxiety and rumination. when i think back on events i want to tell myself a story that is neutral, not one that makes it worse. i don't want to invent problems or spin existing problems out of control. it's hard, but these two things are my mental health resolutions for 2019. **i want to appreciate the good moments, and i want to do my best to ensure that bad ones only hurt me once.**

disclaimer - i'm talking about my own anxiety and rumination over small problems, this isn't meant to dismiss traumatic events that you will naturally feel a lot of anxiety around and ruminate about. terrible and traumatic things happen. this is more about not spending the entire day worrying about something inconsequential.

"weird sensations in head / headaches 28/m/white/320lbs blood pressure good (118/81) (currently dieting and losing weight steadily, uncontrolled anxiety/depression caused lots of weight gain) currently taking zoloft 75mg and metaprolol 12mg (half a tablet twice a day) as well as magnesium supplements and vitamin b12 supplements.

been suffering with weird sensations in my head since december 11th. started off getting very mild headaches with pressure in my right temple. went to urgent care, they ordered a ct scan without contrast which all came back normal. i do suffer from high anxiety and depression which is why i take zoloft. the headaches have always been mild and the pressure has never really been ""severe"" it just kinda scares me. doctor put me on metaprolol because he thinks it may be migraines as i also get some auras (black dots and what not). the pain also seems to get worse when i lay on my right side, that's when the pressure is at its highest. my doctor honestly doesn't seem too worried about it and thinks it's migraines but i don't see why migraines would give me the head pressure. i think it's getting better but it is definitely still there. a couple things, i have very outdated glasses and really need a new prescription, i also notice lately that i think i'm a pretty bad jaw clincher without realizing it. i might be forgetting some details, but one other strange thing is i feel like it was less painful and obvious if i wore a hat, but then i wasn't sure if it was caused from hearing a hat (beanie) so i stopped wearing that. sorry if this is confusing, hopefully someone else has experienced this and may be able to help.",Anxiety,291

why is avpd considered a personality disorder and not a mental illness? so from what i have read seems like avpd is the only pure ego-dystonic personality disorder and usually personality disorders are seen as a flaw in someone's personality and are ego-syntonic in nature but in the case of avpd seems like no one likes to have this condition. so why isn't avpd considered a mental illness because the symptoms of someone with avpd seems to match up with different things like social anxiety and extreme low self esteem? like the symptoms are basically the same in a lot of ways.,Personality disorder,102

i have been hiding my depression &amp; anxiety from friends &amp; family members for the past 29 years because it started when i was a kid. apparently i am too good at pretending i am fine because someone just told me that i am lying about my mental illness &amp; then blocked me so i could not defend myself. i wanted to say tell that to my 650mg of antidepressants &amp; xanax plus the mental illness in my family bloodline. it just makes me disappointed that as someone i thought i could confide in who was dealing with it themselves viewed my trauma as invalid. so now apparently i cannot talk about my depression with someone that has depression either? when you have been covering up your depression for decades,Depression,130

"how to get over fear of therapy/getting help i'm 18 and have never gone to therapy or received any help and i really want to try it out but i'm so terrified of it and keep thinking things such as, 'what if i misinterpret a question and answer ""wrong""' or that i will waste their time by not being completely truthful. i very very rarely open up to anyone and when i do i have the sudden urge to cut off all contact with them which would obviously not be very useful with a therapist. i did once apply for therapy for social anxiety but cancelled the process just as i got to the last step because i convinced myself i was faking it. i want help and i don't want things to get worse but i don't know how to go about it. 

any advice on how to overcome this fear or services available that i should start with?

anyways, what i'm getting at is, i saw myself in the mirror when i walked in, and i couldn't help but think that i look exactly how i want to look. i love how comfy clothes look, my hair is long and messy, and i guess i'm in a good enough state of mind to see myself as cute when my hair covers my face like it did. i am embarrassed that as a guy, i like feeling cute, but i think it's great and i've been told that it actually makes me more attractive. 

but when i was admiring myself in the mirror, i lifted up my hoodie (no i don't wear a shirt underneath my hoodies, the temperature much too hot for that as i can barely wear this hoodie) and i saw that my waist was super skinny. of course, i don't eat much, and i still function fine, so i guess that's okay.

even after surfing multiple websites i'm not able to get exact clarity about if ritalin is considered narcotic or controlled over there (i know it's sched ii here in the us), some say i need my prescriptions and a letter, some say just one or the other, some say it must be in spanish and others don't...

"i am filled with envy, pride and resentment. i will start of by saying that i may or may not be suffering from depression. ever since i turned 21 i started feeling jelous towards my peers: profesionally, academically, relationship wise. i am 27 now and things haven't really improved.

everytime i try to share these emotions with someone, namely my mother she just brushed them off and made no big deal out of them. telling me to just ""man up"" basically. when i shared them with friends they either said nothing or told me to get over it.. as such i bottle these feelings because it seems to be a nuisance to other people. fucking assholes.

i feel envy profesionally because i do not work in the places i wish to work and for positions i want to work at. i am underpaid, working a job i have grown out of for years.

relationship wise, i barely have any friends anymore after college. no partners due to me not taking the initiative to do so. not due to lack of confidence but due to constant daydreaming and fantasizing about being in a relationship instead of actually pursuing it.

i do not feel like an independent person, up till recently i was living with my parents and just now am learning to live on my own. i wanted this to be sooner but due to my own lack of initiative and financial struggles i was not able to.

i have been addicted to pornography and videogames ever since i was a teen. just now i am trying to fix these issues. but its hard man... really hard after 15 years of constant use. makes me feel disgusting. full of hatred. but at any inconvinience or struggle, i immediately resort to these two things.

lately i have been suffering from mood swings from manic anger and anxiety to relative peace serenity and reflection. within the same hour even. i have also seemed to garner small panic attacks at the most ridiculous and inconsequential things that happen to me. 

i talk to myself. alot. alot alot over the years. for about a couple years now this self talk has turnt more negative over time. insulting my own capability and intelligence at any mistake.

there have also been times...in which i contemplated suicide... but not seriously. just the idea of ending it all has crossed my mind.

i dont really know why i wrote this. i guess i also have been feeling lonely.",Depression,419

i said some really obscene things while i was hospitalized and if i had done  (which i did not do thankfully) those things while in psychosis i probably would been put in jail or prison. the reason why i decompensated so bad was because i titrated too fast off of seroquel and started to become extremely delusional.

now, at almost 30, i'm really frustrated because nothing gets better for me. doctors keep trying to treat me for depression or anxiety or adhd, which i do have problems with, but it seems like there are more fundamental, deeply set issues which go unaddressed. i've been interested in psychology since i was a teen, and there have been times where i've considered that i might have avpd before forgetting about it, but recently i began researching this in earnest and pretty much every diagnostic criterion strongly fits me. it's kind of scary how well it describes me and how much the posts in this sub reflect my thoughts &amp; experiences.

"depression makes me feel so crazy and irrational im scared to even talk about it in real life i have spent the majority of the past three years depressed, with a few periods of mania and normalcy interspersed here and there. a common pattern - i will go into therapy of some kind, talk about how i'm depressed, i'm sad all the time, feel like nothing ever helps me, meds never work, i want to kill myself and the only thing stopping me is fear it won't work. get frustrated at all their suggestions, walk out feeling worse than i did going in. then my meds will get adjusted or i'll cycle back up again and feel absolutely fine, and quit therapy until the next crisis. because of this, i'm sure my chart is covered with notes about how i'm a difficult patient, irrational, dramatic, draining, argumentative and i have have clinicians suggest i have borderline pd or at least traits of it. the thing is when i'm euthymic i'm not like this at all. i may be a little more sensitive than the average person but other than that i'm perfectly normal. 

anyway, my point is that i always get embarrassed by how melodramatic i get during depressive episodes and because of this i am scared to go back to therapy and repeat this pattern. i already have a lot of difficulty opening up to people and have always found therapy insanely difficult, and this just makes it worse. i also *know* at this point i'm being irrational and i don't need anyone to point it out to me, but i also don't know what to do when i feel like this that doesn't involve professional help. i'm not sure why i'm posting this, just hoping to hear any advice anyone has or if anyone else feels the same way? i literally feel like depression turns me into a completely different person and i hate it.",Bipolar,327

i run marathons - eat well, take care of myself. i have not run in 2 months because my heart rate going up was freaking me out.
i have been to been to psychiatrist - emd helped but came back.  i have always resisted drugs because the thought of taking medicine made me more anxious.
cut back to hospital - gave me xanax - i calmed down. ekg - blood work - chest x-ray - nothing wrong go home.
doctor gave me 10 xanax just in case - woke up the next day anxious - took a pill (i hate drugs and for years wouldn't even consider it)  
i felt amazing all day - never had any anxious thoughts. took another yesterday morning - same thing - all day no thoughts at all.  that is my best 2 days in 27 years - i felt normal.  it does make me sleepy and i see my psychiatrist  for the first time in 2 years tonight and i am going to ask what my best med treatment is.  i dont like the habit forming nature of xanax but i will discuss it

"could i actually be bipolar? i've been diagnosed with ocd (at 14) adhd (19) social anxiety (19) and depression (14ish), though i had struggled with all of these since i was a kid, but got worse at puberty. i was on luvox from when i was 14 til 18 (i'm 20 now), just for ocd, and it had a moderate effect on that, sort of helped with my mood but barely touched my social anxiety, but i was stable(ish). anyways, a year ago i went back after stopping the luvox because my symptoms all came back really bad with ocd and my depression, and the doc pointed out the other issues too. and i was given a zoloft prescription, but i didn't take it for several months until everything became unbearable. i ended up stopping it after a week though, because i think i became a little manic almost when i took it, i had barely any sleep, full of energy, i was talking really fast (which is an achievement when i already talk fast), i felt amazing, though my head felt like it was about to explode, and then i started to worry that i was going to bite my tongue off (that was ocd), and then i became like scarily numb, and i stopped taking it because i was freaking out.
point is, the past year, my ocd is much better and i have been in therapy for it, but my depression has just gotten worse, i had an episode at uni and then i dropped out, and i got better when i started fixing my social anxiety and met a guy, then after i broke up with a guy, my depression came back worse than ever, and when i was on luvox, i got depressed, but these days i have a lot more suicidal thoughts and urges to hurt myself, which are becoming more and more frequent, so i'm going to ask for some antidepressants when i get my adhd prescription refilled (she has said several times she wants to prescribe lexapro but i refused).
anyway, i was remembering what happened when i started the zoloft, and i had read that when people with diagnosed bipolar take antidepressants it can trigger an episode. my question is, is it possible that i do have bipolar and i've just mainly been depressed, or can meds trigger that even if you aren't bipolar? i'm just a little worried i don't want to fuck up my life any further than i have, and i just needed to ramble a bit.

"is face burning sensations something that can be attributed to anxiety? my life has been a big mess since august. a dizziness episode triggered my health anxiety. i suspected ms - did an mri, an ssep - they found nothing. then, i moved onto als. nothing again. several neurologists said i had nothing but anxiety, and still i kept thinking the opposite.

in january i woke up with my right side tingling/pins and needles, followed by a toothache. of course, i googled these symptoms and found trigeminal neuralgia - a condition that checks all the boxes of a hypochondriac nightmare.

i had a cavity, did a root canal, the toothache disappeared. but the tingling is still here and around my eye i have been dealing with burning sensations - eyelid, eyelashes, inside the eye. it's not unbearable and maddening like those who have trigeminal neuralgia say it is, but it's really uncomfortable.

i've seen two major neurosurgeons about this, they said i didn't have trigeminal neuralgia. i don't know, i can't find peace, i'm always startled, nervous and expecting to be hit by a major wave of unbearable pain. 

i really don't know anything anymore. don't know if is my ha causing this, or if in fact i have this condition but doctors are simply being dismissive. one thing that makes me believe that my anxiety is the root is that the burning gets tuned down/disappears when i'm distracted. but it hits me again when i'm alone at home working, for instance.

i am not really sure what to title this. i have been struggling with mdd with psychotic features and anxiety. i have no support group at all. 99% of people i try to talk to make it into a competition saying oh my life was work or they just tell me it will be okay or it will get better. my family does not care at all about me. my friends are not supportive at all and neither is my gf. i have woken up everyday exausted and i hate the way i look so much. i want to go to the gym but i do not have transportation and everytime i ask my gf to go she tells me no because she likes me the way i am. i try to explain to her how i do not like myself and she does not listen. i try so hard even tho it takes so much effort for her and its never returned. nothing feels good enough for her. she barely shows affection she gets mad at me for joking around. everyone around me makes me feel like my problems do not have any value. i try to talk to people about how i am suicidal and want to kill myself and i always get told to stop talking about it. i tried to kms last year and all of a sudden everyone cared and wanted to be there for me and hang out but like a week later it was back to the way it was before that. i am extremely miserable. all i can remember from my childhood is the stuff that happened to me. i still hear my dads voice in my head making fun of me when i would eat or i would randomly remember the daily beating. i just do not understand what is the point of life is everyday is going to be like this. there just so much to talk about because i never get to talk about it to anyone. sorry for the rant. i appreciate you if you read it all even if you do not respond. not sure,Depression,358

"i am 16. unlike a lot of schools mine has groups for just about everyone because it is huge (3000 students). so you have to be especially weird and a true loser to not have friends. of course there is people i bullshit with in class but i have not spoken to anyone except my parents in the last 2 months, i am afraid to go anywhere with my parents for fear of being seen by someone i know from school and being laughed at. it really hits hardest when i am holed up inside watching scp videos in my room on a beautiful day. instead of going out with my friends like literally everyone else, i am watching youtube and working on a summer assignment for ap classes that i would not take if my parents did not demand i work hard in school. they have some delusion that i will be a genius who makes them money. lol. honestly scp is the best fandom for the depressed, it let us me forget how boring the world is and it let us me fantasize about something i would enjoy. the brutal reality is the scp universe is one of very few fictional universes where people like me matter. in real life being a weird science lover who enjoys thinking about stuff without a deadline ruins your life. irl dr. bright would live in his mom's basement. man, it stings to turn off the youtube video or close the article tab and remember real life. that is the other thing. i really want to work as hard as i can to avoid being a parasite. i will work as hard as i need to to play video games and watch scp videos in my own basement. i am not going to let life disappear while ruining my parents financial state. i am planning to study abroad and emigrate to a country (most likely belgium) better suited for 20 year olds to live alone than america. i also hate when people act like i do not enjoy learning. i do. i just hate having to take tests when i will never produce anything of value for all my work. i like to just think about stuff and read interesting things, i just hate people forcing me to do it. sorry i am rambling again. anyway i have already got an internship as a journalist, so i am trying to get the ball rolling on not living in my parents basement. well, time to go bury my head in fiction to forget my shitty life. the best part about scp? very few relationships. they are a whole organization full of people like me! sunday afternoon and the scp foundation",Depression,457

for the last few days, i've had some loose-ish stools, a bit of weakness/fatigue, but mainly i'm concerned about a dull pain that moves around my chest. today it's mostly been on my left side and about 30 min ago went into my left shoulder. its not constant and it can be lower right, upper left, whatever. i'm terrified i have a pulmonary embolism or some sort of clot. i know i'm probably panicking for no reason and i hate annoying my dad with this stuff and he makes me feel crazy which doesn't help. so... any wisdom? thank you in advance!",Anxiety,230

"proud of myself hi everyone! it's been a while since i posted on this sub and i really wanted to share a small success story to hopefully help you if you need it.

so this past summer i was active on here all the time. i was convinced i had a brain tumour, bone cancer, blood clots, and a bunch of other issues. 

i ended up starting therapy in september and it's been going great! i've been able to stop immediately seeking reassurance (i.e. going to the er) and dealing with my fear of death. i still struggle with googling and the initial worry of symptoms, but i can honestly say i'm starting to get better.

anyways, i feel like i had a major milestone today - even if it doesn't really seem like that big of a deal. 

my health anxiety is mostly focused on myself, but also extends to other people i care about, like my family. so naturally, when my mom told me she found a large lump on her breast while showering, i panicked. like full blown panic. i immediately thought the worst (shocker), especially because just two months ago she'd gotten called back for an abnormal mammogram and had to do a bunch of imaging tests to make sure it was nothing terrible. that week waiting for results was excruciating (thankfully it was just benign cysts). naturally, this brought me back to that terrible week of worry, and i was immediately thinking that, despite 2 mammograms + an ultrasound not even two full months ago, that the doctors must have missed something and that she had a terrible disease.

my initial instinct was to google - i tend to seek out information in times of stress because it helps me feel like i have some control over the situation. i was so tempted to google incidence rates of breast cancer, likelihood of breasts cyst vs. cancer, and the like. i had intentions of reassuring myself, but i also knew that doing that would only feed into my anxiety and make it worse. despite how badly i wanted to do research, i forced myself to ignore the compulsion. i was also able to rationalize and talk through my fears to come up with a logical conclusion (i.e. family history of cystic breasts = likelihood of cyst vs. cancer)

thankfully, our family doctor believes that it's just a cyst that was seen on the mammogram, but filled with fluid due to her upcoming period. he's sending her for an ultrasound to be safe, but overall isn't worried.

however, despite all this, i feel really proud of myself! i managed to avoid googling because i knew it would harm me, even if i was convinced it would help me. i really feel like i accomplished something, and i hope that sharing this encourages any of you who need help to get it. therapy has been a godsend for me, even if it's just in small steps like this.",Anxiety,500

"tinnitus thinking, panic attacks. please help me. i recently came across a video about people ""curing"" their tinnitus temporarily. i had no idea what tinnitus was so i decided to google it. turns out that i might actually have it myself. i hear a faint high frequency sound everytime i cover my ears with my hands and during complete silence. i always thought it was normal to hear this at times when nothing can be heard. i've had a panic attack since noticing it and noticing that it can't be cured. 

i'm still wondering if i have this and if my head is just making this up.. since i've never ever noticed this before. but i can't stop thinking about it and covering my ears to hear if its still there. i'm terrified and shaking.

i'm so afraid that i will never be able to not hear this sound now when completely silent. i'm sure that i've had this all my life if i do have this.. but i still wish that i never discovered this disease. help me, what should i do??

"avpd and covid has ruined my dream job. so i've been a nanny for about 10 years now (daycare before that) and one of the best parts of the job was extremely minimal adult interaction. i'd go to work, one of the parents would tell me what i needed to know and then went to work. when they got back in the evening we'd say ""goodnight"" and that was it. 

since covid, however, at least one of the parents works from home. i currently work for a family with both parents work from home. it's terrible. i jump at every noise that might mean they are coming to ""say hi"" to their kid. i worry so much about where they are, what they think they're hearing when i talk to their baby, my appearance, the way i dress. i imagine they're mocking the way i sneeze or they're disgusted by my weight gain.

i am very good at my job but my anxiety is so distracting it makes everything so much harder. i can't tell you how many times i've tossed my phone across the room when i hear footsteps coming because even if i am only looking up the weather or craft ideas i'm terrified they'll think i'm on the phone all day.",Personality disorder,214

"apologies in advance if this post does not totally make sense, i am feeling emotional and i am also a bit high...i have been feeling extra suicidal for the past couple weeks, have a history of attempts, and i think sometimes when the suicidal feelings are this strong they stay strong until i 'do' something about them, i.e. try to off myself. and today i have been seriously considering doing it again, and am honestly trying to talk myself into it because the logistics are right (dog would be taken care of) and i had a therapy session today that basically seemed to confirm for me that things are hopeless and are not going to change any time soon. but, ambivalence.so...my dilemma is that if i am rational enough to think that i should maybe take myself to the psychiatric hospital er, then presumably that is me deciding not to kill myself, so then why am i even at the er? but if i do not take myself there, it is like suicide is still on the table and it is a 'should i or should not i' kind of torture until the point when these feelings get a little less strong (which is not necessarily any time soon, based on recent history) or i am upset enough to stop thinking rationally and try something impulsive. and i know i would just fail again. and i cannot deal with more of that flavour of shame.i know asking for advice on the internet for a topic like this is not ideal, so i am not asking whether you think i should go to the hospital or not, but maybe share what you have done if you have found yourself in a similar situation? i usually do not find helplines helpful and it is been a while since i went to er and i am just not sure if this is one of those times when it makes sense to go. i do not want to feel like a moron telling them i am there because i do not want to kill myself, and be stuck there for hours when it is not like they are going to be able to help improve anything short term. i already see a psychiatrist every other week so it is not like i need them to connect me with that resource. but going it alone when i am at this point can be scary and feels really painful and is probably kind of stupid sometimes. &amp;#x200b;tl;dr when you have felt really suicidal but rational enough to realize you should do something to prevent yourself from acting on it, what did you do? how did it work out? need thoughts on going to the er or not",Suicidal,461

"i need therapy. i don't like posting anything about myself online because in the long run i feel like it only makes things worse, but i need advice from people with experience. i'm 30 years old, and despite having a job that allows me to pay the bills i feel the lowest i've ever felt in my life. i'm mentally and physically exhausted the majority of the day, and despite making changes in my diet and exercise i feel completely empty.

i felt better and more alive when i spent my weekends heavily drinking, even though those nights would usually end with me having heart palpitations and feeling like i was going to die. at least when i was inebriated i could feel a spark of the happiness i had when i was younger and that feeling made me want to drink more and more just to keep that spark alive. unfortunately, now when i drink i get panic attacks that take days for me to get over so it's not even an option for me anymore.

for the first time in my life i'm considering therapy because at this point i don't know what other alternative to turn to. the only reason its taken me this long to consider it an option is because i feel like i already know what a therapist would say to me. as pessimistic and presumtuous as it is, it seemed pointless. i'll admit it would be nice to vent to someone but is that really all there is to it? i have to be wrong.

"hi! i will be as brief as possible and i will try to lay this out clearly. thank you so much for taking the time to read my post!background: i am going through rather a hard time at the moment. i had to take off work until september due to severe depression, which i have suffered with for about 7 years now. it came to a head last year, when my pretty horrible boyfriend of nearly a decade finally left me. this is the first time i have ever had to go on ""sick leave,"" and i hate it. i am so, so lucky that i have this option, but i still feel embarrassed and frustrated that it is come to this point. problem: i have been seeing a psychologist and he always tells me to make friends. he is been harping on it for the last few weeks and this last friday he gave it to me as my ""homework,"" for our next session. truth be told i really, really want a good friend because i have never actually had one before. my problem is that i have already *tried* to make new friends, and it went horribly. back in february he gave me a similar piece of ""homework,"" and i ended up emailing some people i know pretty well from work and church. i worked hard on the emails, personalized them, and i had really high hopes when i sent them out. hopes which were dashed when nobody responded to any of the emails. i feel crazy admitting this, but this put me in a pretty horrible state for a while and really killed what was left of my self esteem. i honestly do not think i will ever be ready to do that again, because another rejection like that could actually kill me. i do, however, recognize that i have to pull myself back up and try again if i ever want to get better.question: what is the safest way for a very sensitive, sad woman to make friends? is there any way to reach out to people with less risk of rejection? all the mental health websites i can find recommend ""reaching out to people,"" or ""making friends"" but none of them tell me what to do in the event that nobody wants to be my friend. i am just really, really scared of being rejected again. what is the safest way for a very depressed woman to make new friends?",Depression,415

"first time poster so excuse my grammar and format...i met my wife about 3 years ago, fast i know but i was so happy. i had been so lost and depressed and i found some one who showed real interest in me...some one who loved me for me. but i had my own issues and problems. i hurt her over and over (not physically and i never cheated) and she gave me chance after chance. we had a beautiful baby girl 13 months ago...finally i had the family i always wanted...a family of my own, a beautiful wife and daughter. but i continued to screw myself and her over with my actions...i was not present mentally...i was not supportive enough. we would get into arguments that made both of us want to kill our selves. we have both tried at different points...we both self harm. but now its all over...our relationship is dead to her. she really tried, i did not try nearly hard enough. i did love her, i really did...but i am just a selfish bastard. we did not end in a horrible way at all, in fact we still live together for the sake of our daughter. but for all the times i have hurt her...for all the chances i had...i guess this karma coming full circle? i just feel so broken, hollow and cold. like i am not the one who should get any form of pity...i felt so bad that i need to vent in some way...to feel...something. i cut my self bad enough to need a hospital visit...i guess that box cutter was not as dull as i thought. but the funny thing is i did not even feel it...i feel like i am regressing back into the person i used to be...the one who shuts out the world. cutting made me feel better for a little bit...but its not enough. i do not want to die, more like i cannot die. my daughter did not ask to be here, and i owe it to her to stay around for her. but i want it to end deep down...i keep thinking i should have died in that motorcycle accident years before we met. if i did not have my daughter, i probably would have put a bullet in my head already.for all the mistakes i made...i am so sorry...i wish i could take it all back. i wish i could start over again. i was so happy for the first time in years...and now its all gone. i am such a fool. i think i need to be medicated...but i just cannot afford that kind of thing right now, let alone set professional help.anyway...i just wanted to rant/vent...thanks venting-i lost everything i ever wanted due to my own mistakes",Depression,465

"can 24/7 anxiety cause brain-tumor like symptoms? 19yo male here, i eat really healthy and exercise regularly everyday just to preface. 

i've always suffered from severe anxiety, particularly health anxiety, and depression(to less of an extent), i remember at 12 the fear of testicular cancer just plaguing my every thought for months because of a dull ache in my testes.

anyway, just before i started university for the first time a friend died of brain cancer, and all of my close friends' moms died of breast cancer when i was young, so i have a warped perception of how common it is, i guess. aside from this my life has been filled with death, my father is terminally ill, my mum was suicidal and almost died of blood poisoning, my grandma had vascular dementia and we cared for her at home until her death, more beyond this, grandparents, friends' parents, uncles and aunts.

my anxiety since starting uni has worsened, i suffer an elevated heart rate and sweats 24/7, extreme worrying thoughts all the time, trembling hands, especially bad at night. 

i've not had any memory issues or coordination issues, it's literally just headaches, for the past few weeks i've been getting pain in very singular spots, never a full over generalised headache, it lasts for a few seconds to a minute and then disappears, and this happens a few times through the day. 
the kicker is if i can remove myself from my anxiety it doesn't really happen, i was shopping all of yesterday with my girlfriend and didnt have any issues at all until we got into a quiet taxi, at which point my thoughts went rampant.

i just feel like my anxiety is killing me, and it's really spearheaded into this fear of a tumor. i sleep awfully too because of my anxiety and grind my teeth severely, as well as holding my shoulders up and tight all the time. 

every rational part of me says it's all a mental thing, but i cannot get that rational part of my brain to win over, i'm in constant states of terror and get these huge adrenaline rushes physically crashing over me daily.

should i see a doctor? should i be hugely worried from the point of view of a tumour? i've finally after years managed to bring myself to see a therapist, i start next week, i've  just always felt myself as being a drama queen, but my life isn't even enjoyable anymore, i'm so sickly worried all the time. thanks

"convinced i have mri contrast dye poisoning weeks after a brain mri. need help coping. using a somewhat new throwaway account, sorry if my karma is low. i'm sort of new to the realization that i have ha, but it all makes sense now. i've always had anxiety, but it's definitely evolved into this about 6 months ago.

a few months back, i had some strange symptoms that were related to jaw pain. i've pretty much figured out what's wrong there, but because of that, i've seen a slew of doctors including a neurologist. my doctor ordered a brain mri with contrast just to be safe. i stupidly googled if the contrast dye can cause adverse reactions in people (i strongly suggest you don't google it.) anyway, after the mri, i felt nauseated, which set my ha into a tailspin. 

now, a few weeks later, i'm noticing that my feet, hands, and legs suddenly go cold, especially when i'm sitting down. i'm talking freezing cold, even if the rest of my body is warm. when they finally warm up, i get pins and needles all down my legs and today, i woke up with muscle spasms in my feet and legs. my scumbag brain is telling me i have some type of weird contrast dye poisoning that isn't curable, you know how it goes.

my feet getting freezing cold does happen when i'm not in what i would say would be a heightened state of anxiety. it usually sends me into a state of anxiety which i'm sure definitely doesn't help my extremities. it's a real chicken/egg scenario.

does this sound like anxiety to anyone or should i actually be concerned? i mean, i'm young (just turned 30,) i exercise about 4 or 5 times a week, i eat pretty healthy, and am all around healthy. in my mind, this should not be happening, but, here i am. i'm also worried that if i go to the doctor and ask him to test to see if i still have the dye in my system, he's going to think i'm crying wolf and won't take me seriously when something else is wrong.

i definitely need the sage advice of other ha veterans. i'm new to this and don't know how to tell my brain to stop worrying about it. it won't, and i feel out of control, like i can't shut it off.",Anxiety,402

"panic, pain and tingling in limbs - is my birth control driving me crazy? hi there everybody! it's my first time posting here but my anxiety is skyrocketing recently, so here's a quick summary of my problem:

i feel constantly stressed and pressured due to mental health reasons. last year, during a very stressful stretch at work, i passed out the first time and i've had dizzy spells ever since. had blood work and an examination with a heart rate monitor made, nothing major except for a slightly lower blood pressure. thought i was going to die the entire time, of course, but it got better then aside from me growing obsessed with my health.

fast forward to today. after stressing for a whole month that i might've gotten myself pregnant i finally started birth control on the 16th, thinking i might finally chill, but nope! now i'm convinced i'm developing a thrombosis or something worse. i had a panic attack last week that my so had to talk me through, thinking i was having a lung ebolism, and now suddenly my right foot, wrist, upper arm and leg hurt, i get tingles in my right little and ringfinger, and occasionally there's this burning sensation around my knee and elbow that just... make no sense whatsoever? travels to my left side sometimes, too, and my hands are often cold.

can someone please tell me that i'm okay? i've been to my doctor so many times this month because of different things and i'm so embarrassed to turn up there so often for little to no diagnosis. i should know my symptoms are too much over the place to be anything serious, but i just want to go through a single day again without me obsessing over every little pin &amp; needle that i'm feeling. :(",Anxiety,305

"i moved to utah about a year and a half ago. we went outside of the polluted city for the first time during the pandemic. we stayed for so long that it was pitch-black on the drive home. i looked out the car window and was able to see the entire milkyway, millions of stars and the bluish purple hues. i was so overwhelmed because it was my first time seeing so many stars. i felt like i was going to fall in to the sky. all i could think about since that was that i wanted to go out in the wild again and lay down and watch the stars all night. during some very tough days this past year, my boyfriend asked me what i wanted to do, he was ready to take me anywhere and make it happen just to see me happy again. i asked him to take me to see the stars again. its so fucking cliche, i am so sorry but that is just what i really wanted. so he promised me. we never actually went. whenever it comes up, its always either too expensive, too dangerous, i am not trying hard enough to plan it, hes not super interested in seeing it anyway etc. we have been wanting to go somewhere but everything is too expensive and not worth it. yet he goes out drinking every weekend and ends up spending hundreds of dollars and gets trashed.yesterday he was on the phone with one of his friends and his friend mentioned going to a popular camping spot (also popular star gazing spot) and within minutes they planned a trip to go the next day. i was in the room and could hear the entire conversation. they went out drinking to discuss the plans and i was not invited or even looked at in the face. i left his apartment and went home. i feel so betrayed and lonely. am i overreacting? maybe, but considering it was literally the only thing my depressed ass wanted to do, i think its okay to feel extremely upset and want to break up with him because i literally have no worth to him. i am not good enough to camping with for 1 night, not even good enough to be invited to the one thing i wanted to do. and if its another event i am always invited last minute and never have time to get ready and he complains that hes sick of explaining why i do not show up at events. i feel like hes just setting me up for failure and complaining to me about it. i had only one thing i was actually looking forward to this entire year and my boyfriend betrayed me",Depression,461

"decrease stress by adding a hormetic stressor into your life. one of the best ways to decrease how much total stress you experience is by adding good forms of stress (short and moderate) called hormetic stressors.  cold water is a prototypical hormetic stressor.  it releases stress hormones like adrenaline and noradrenaline but it is short and not extreme.   

we just launched an app that provides guided cold showers to make it easy for you to do them.  it is led by a master chief navy seal.  we teach you a set of mental tools around tactical breathwort, body relaxation, self talk, etc.  these tools not only make cold showers easier but they also help you handle stress more generally.    

in fact, the best way to train yourself to handle stress better is to systematically stress yourself and then practice these tools while stressed.  if you do that, these tools will become reflexive any time your body generates stress hormones.

(do not know the right word, it was basicaly an 'awake operation' where they tried to reduce the tumor). she went into a coma afterwards and never woke up again.now, i have seen my best friend, my mother die from that. i visited her as often as i could and felt like she reacted to my voice. a few days before her death there was none of that. she was simply sleeping, connectes to all the machines. i hated that sight, it crushed me. the day of the funeral i had so much anger in me. i was angry at life, at my father. she did not deserve that. i know that there are worse cases, i know all of that. but after all, she was my mother and my best friend. so much for the prologue. a month after her death i got a pulse synchronized (?) tinnitus. basically a whooshing sound to the beat of my heart. i got heavy dizzy spells and could not walk. went to my doc, got my blood checked, ct done, 24 hour heart rate measured and what not. everything is 'fine'.and most of all i feel so foggy. literally 24/7 for a year now. it feels like i am hanging on a thread of conciousness. i am just not 'here'. my forehead feels tingly when i move it. i do not know anymore. is it depression, trauma? my doc said to seek out a therapist but i have a huge fear of having something physically wrong with me. its exhausting and i miss being clear in my head. everything is slower and sometimes it feels like my brain is too slow for my eyes.i do not know, sounds like a rant (which it is partly). but i am simply exhausted. what is going on",Depression,408
"tw transphobia i guess for anyone affected /i am trans and it just makes me want to die so fucking bad. i am sure all of you know this already but being trans is one of the most disgusting and revolting things i could ever be, and a huge burden on everyone both medically and emotionally (by forcing everyone to say my pronouns, and when they get them wrong of course they feel bad about it). i have tried to detransition but nothing ever sticks, i am just fucking stuck like this forever i guess. i feel like a monster, i have fucked up my body by going on hormones and getting my chest sliced up and now i look worse than i ever have. i used to be a beautiful girl and now i am a disgusting freak of nature and i just wish i could go back and never even realize this in the first place. it has ruined every single thing in my life in ways i could have never imagined :( if i cannot detransition and be a normal human being again by next year i think ill just kill myself. the world is better off without another disgusting person like me anywaysif you have any thoughts feel free to share them, if you are transphobic you can tell me about it in the comments if you want, it might help me get my shit together and detransition if i hear about why its so terrible from others. the people around me are too accepting of trans people so i do not get enough shit for deciding to do this i just wish i could be normal",Suicidal,281

"one of the big pieces of advice i see for depressed people online is to ""find a hobby"" or find something fulfilling. i can see how this would be a great piece of advice, if it actually worked for me. any time i pick something new up, i kind of enjoy it, keep doing it for a few weeks (maybe even a month if i am lucky), get bored and then stop. rinse and repeat, every goddamn time. i have tried the gym, running, tennis, football, joining a hell even playing video games i get bored of eventually. maybe it is because of my depression, but i really struggle to find something i actually enjoy to the point of wanting to do it as much as possible over a long period of time. most things that i find which i genuinely enjoy, my enjoyment/determination fizzles out after a few weeks to the point where my effort put in outweighs my enjoyment so i just stop. how do people find things they enjoy and actually want to stick with it for a long period of time??anyone have any advice? how the fuck do people find things they actually like and stick with it??",Depression,202

"anti-stress device research  hello all,

we are a group of university students who are in the process of creating a functional prototype for patients with heart disease and/or anxiety disorders, as well as for people who lead a stressful lifestyle.

it is a relatively small wearable device placed on your chest that allows you to start a vibration in the chest area in the event of a panic attack to calm the heart, thereby helping you to more easily achieve cardiac coherence, which is proven to calm the organism.

"i can't imagine what friendship would look like in my life i'm in my 40s now. the last time i had friends was in school. i'm not sure we would have been friends if the we hadn't been in the same environment day after day. actually i'm pretty sure we wouldn't have been. my friends mostly were other people who didn't have other friends, i.e. other outsiders. 

we'd meet to play computer games, or sometimes (rarely) go swimming. but we never really talked about personal stuff. i'm not even sure this counts as friendship?

anyway...so i've been without that kind of social connection for a long time now. too busy struggling with education and work and health and life in general to engage in hobbies. 

i think i really have no idea what friendship is apart from seeing it on tv or remembering childhood friends. is it more than spending time together and watching tv or engaging in hobbies together? am i even capable of friendship?

consequently, friendship isn't something i've been looking for. maybe if i knew what i'm missing out on, i would?

why is avpd considered a personality disorder and not a mental illness? so from what i have read seems like avpd is the only pure ego-dystonic personality disorder and usually personality disorders are seen as a flaw in someone's personality and are ego-syntonic in nature but in the case of avpd seems like no one likes to have this condition. so why isn't avpd considered a mental illness because the symptoms of someone with avpd seems to match up with different things like social anxiety and extreme low self esteem? like the symptoms are basically the same in a lot of ways.,Personality disorder,102
"yin yoga is a wonderful way to regulate the nervous system and manage stress  i am a ma level clinical mental health counselor and was recently certified as a yin yoga therapy instructor. though i cannot offer individualized/catered sessions, i do provide yin yoga classes on youtube (@wildheartyogahh) as a free resource to help those who may not be able to afford help in other ways. many people store emotional energy in the body- specifically in the fascia, since 80% of nerve pathways end in the fascia- and yin targets release of fascia and connective tissue through long (3+ min), passive holds. it is a wonderful, gentle practice, for the mind and body! hope it can help someone. :)",Stress,119

"this is my first post ever talking about my depression, idk where to start. this past week i have been sick with a minor cold and while being sick it made me realize how much of a loser i am in life. i am currently unemployed and stressed about going back to community college knowing i lost my financial aid privilege from being a careless idiot in the past. my mom has spoiled me too much growing up and i took it for granted. it really hurts me to know i have not accomplished anything in life yet just to put a smile on her face. i had a job back in early may where i working a physical therapy aide position but did not even last a month there. i thought i was doing fine until i got a phone call to not come into work anymore. i cannot even hold down a job ffs. no one in my family knows i got fired yet, too embarrassed to tell them. i do not think i have lasted at any job for more than a year. i have been applying to a few places, but no responses. i think i was meant to be a loser in life. today was the first day i broke down completely in a long time when i came into a realization that i have pretty much 0 growth since i graduated high school back in 2017. since middle school, i always had low self-esteem. i never tried to man up. i was lucky enough to be in a 5-year relationship w my high school love. my low self-esteem issues were the reason we went our separate ways when i would always decline invitations to do activities with other people. it is weird bc i do weight training at the gym every week since i was 17, and you would think that would build complete confidence, but the self-esteem issues are still there. i wake up late everyday in my same depressing room, open up my laptop and watch useless youtube videos, gym, come back home and do the same thing. i really have nobody to text or socialize with besides my sister. i would say my older sister is my only friend at the moment. she graduated from college a few years ago and works a job related to her career. she always gives me advice, but i would brush it off bc i am too pussy to completely open up to her. i am going crazy. the day is almost over and what did i even do today? i am a little kid in a young adult's body 22-year old in deep depression. now starting to go crazy",Depression,455
"being born mortal is worse than not having been born in the first place. my mortality recently hit me for real, and it's been sending me into a deep depression. everything feels utterly pointless, because no matter how well i live, i'll die and not remember any of it. there won't be any legacy of me, since the universe itself will die in the end. nothing has any point to it, we're just here to plug our ears and pretend that we're never going to die, despite also being certain of it. my whole life just fell apart, and now i can barely enjoy things knowing it'll all be gone. i keep mourning my friends and family, knowing everything i do with them amounts to nothing. no professional help or medication can change these things. existence is just a prison where they dangle all these wonderful things in front of you, and then remind you that you'll be dead and none of it will have mattered. there's no afterlife, no legacy, nothing. this feels like the cruelest joke imaginable. i have zero motivation to pursue a career, knowing it's all for nothing. i can barely enjoy my hobbies, knowing they're just a distraction and won't be remembered by anyone.",Depression,209

"there is a lot of things about my illness that make life difficult, but one of the consistently hardest hitting things is the realization that life is not supposed to be this way.things have been like this for so long that it just feels like the way things should be to me. i am not used to anything else so i just go through my day feeling dark and empty like its completely normal way to function.but every now and then something reminds me that most people are not like this. most people are able to look outside and consistently see green. most people go through every day without deathwish daydreaming. the way my life is is statistically not normal. and everytime i realize that, it hits with me with a truck.the main reason its so normalized is because almost all of my friends, when i express ideation, respond with same or make light of it. its so normalized in my life because everyone knows how hard things are for me. but every now and then i meet someone who is neurotypical, and eventually i open up to much and they are shocked.for reference: if anyone here knows the game doki doki literature club, i was talking to my coworker and started talking about sayori. i talked about her entire dynamic of masking suffering with humor, and her eventual fate. it was kind of a subtle projection. after i finished talking, my coworkers face went kind of dark and they became quiet. i am not sure if they realized where the thought came from or if they were just shocked and uncomfortable, but it was a reminder that not everyone expects life to be dark all the time.sorry for the rant. i do not have anyone to talk to anymore. the realization is difficult for me",Depression,306

"how can i get out of the loop - depression is taking my life away i have been struggling with anxiety and depression for a long time now, and eating disorders in the past that have not fully healed.

the trigger this time was that i saw a photo my broyfriend took of me and my legs appeared enormous to me. that single thought that arised from a photo that a loved one took on me, lead to not eating in three days, self-injuries and an endless loop of feeling like shit. i feel so narcissistic and chidlish, why would my looks be at all this important? still now i cannot get over it. just seeing my legs in a photo that was taken with love. my boyfriend almost threw me out of home cos i was behaving like a fucking idiotic child.

yet it is so hard to get out of the loop, i literally have nothing that makes me feel happy and i consider myself to be under the normal for intelligence and i don't have any special skills so i don't see a point in feeling better with myself. i feel so miserable, so useless, i only bring dark stuff to my lovely boyfriend. it's like i know how to get out of the loop (my therapist gave me many tips) but still when i am in the middle i cannot get out, my mind is racing with destructive shit that i believe and i act according to all these thoughts.

the eating disorder has already been on for 13 years and i am already 30. i never imagined at this point of my life i would still be dealing my so many instrusive thoughts and still thinkking this is such a big of an issue. its like really, who is going to notice i put on weight? and if they do, why would it be so importnat? there are far many things more importnat than looks, but i seem to not be able to get over it anyhow. i feel like i should really die if am not skinny.

"hi, i am new here and this is my first post. a lack of human connection+ crippling depression+ a series of unfortunate events have lead me to write this. i do not know what i want, some empathy, a community maybe. anyway, trigger warning, the post mentions blood/injuries/suicide.i have had depression for as long as i can recall, but for the last few months it has intensified and trapped me in ways i cannot explain. i was doing well, i had a self care routine that worked somewhat, but over the past few months things just went haywire. my mother- (with whom i have a v complicated relationship) had a pretty bad injury, then another and then another. so now i live in constant fear of hearing my dad shout my name from.the other room only to rush into the room to find my mother lying a pool of blood, again. for the third time. my stomach drops and heart starts pounding. the same old ensues again. they rush to the hospital i clean the mess up. i am tired of scrubbing blood. at this point i have stopped telling my friends oh it happened again because idk i do not think they would understand what cleaning up ur mother's blood does to a person. i still do not grasp it fully, i am just numb atm. 2 days ago i was withering in my bed for a solid 2 hours pleading god to kill me. that did not work.i dread taking showers because every single time i so much so as touch my hair it falls in clusters. weekly hair wash days are crucial so i go through w them but afterwards left w a sense of loss and major despair. i keep telling myself its ok everything will be okay, everything has to be okay but i do not know reallyi've got a major exam coming up, in less than a month! i get constant brain fog plus all this stress. my head hurts. i am so so heavy a crisis",Depression,343
ok maybe i am being stupid here but i feel like no one really gets it. i lay in bed all day everyday without a job or anything to do. my friends are also depressed but like i see such a huge difference in their life and mine. they go to work and school and are not constantly thinking of ways to die. maybe its just me but does anyone else feel like people just do not understand and that i am just beyond hope. thanks for reading my rant. depresion,Depression,91
"last week i tested positive for covid for the first time.ever since then, my whole family is now positive. i do not even know how i got it, or if i am the one who infected them, but i just do not care at this point.i was doing so well. i was spending time with my friends and family (outdoors, with masks when needed). i had a workout routine and was feeling so confident in myself. i was going to therapy every week. practicing self care. exploring my spirituality.then, this happens. i am in constant pain, no energy, my lungs burn when i breathe. i cannot sleep. i cannot do weightlifting and my body dysmorphia is back full force. i cannot be around my loved ones. i cannot go to therapy. i cannot read or draw or focus on my hobbies because of the disorientation. i cried more this week than i have in months. i do not want to eat, or move, or exist. i feel immeasurable guilt for possibly bringing this home.why is it every time i am doing better, life gives me a big old middle finger up the ass? am i destined to be miserable? i wish i could just die. depression and covid-19",Depression,208
"i have been feeling depressed this year and it intensified after my wedding in may. i am feeling tired, demotivated, worthless. all i want to do is just to sleep. my husband has not been providing me with the support i need, if he did something that triggers my depression and anxiety, he would just brush it off or denying things without offering me anything to make me feel better. which reaffirms my thoughts about being worthless. i started seeing a therapist last week, but were only meeting once every week. what would i do in between?i feel so alone. how do i cope? i have no support",Depression,108

"okay so i am writing this bc i feel like i have no one else to talk to about this and i am not really quite sure what exactly i am feeling right now. so i keep thinking to myself i want to die. this usually happens when i am really anxious or just very sad about a situation. i do not think i could ever actually end my life or really even cut myself. i just keep having these thoughts that i wish i was not alive. i am wondering if this is suicidal thoughts or no. i have this issue where i think that my problems are not that bad and that i could be worse off. i do not want to hear things like please do not, you have so much to live for because i already know it would not be a smart idea and i seriously do not think i am to that point where i want to harm myself. its so hard for me to express my emotions and let people know how i am really feeling and i do not know how to stop this. idk, anything helps at this point i do not know my feelings",Depression,204

"i am 17, been on effexor for about a year. i was suicidal before starting it and now i feel mostly fine. i am going off of it because i feel like it has affected my ability to maintain relationships - both girlfriends i have had while i have been on it, i feel like i have not been able to actually connect with them emotionally, like i cannot fall in love with them. i have heard other people share similar stories. also, i am sexually active with my girlfriend and i cannot cum - we have had sex probably like twice a week, for the last 2 months, and i have finished exactly 1 time. its horrible. for a while i could not even get it up. but anyways, that is why i am going off it. what should i do to try to prevent my depression from coming back once i am off it? i am currently in the process of weaning off of effexor. i am at like half of my dose of 75 mg, planning on cutting that to 0 in 2 weeks or so, once i run out of pills. how do i make sure my depression does not come back after going off of antidepressants?",Depression,211

"brain tumor anxiety hey reddit. i'll start by saying that i'm a huge 22 year old hypochondriac. it started in last december, when i pooped a lot of blood and i was convinced that i've got colon cancer, i couldn't function properly for a whole month before i got my colonoscopy which revealed a small benign polyp which was removed.  
 
anyways, since yesterday all i've been reading about is brain tumors. the reason of that is, when i was in work yesterday (slept only 6 hours and didn't have breakfast, then worked from 8 am to 2 pm) i kind of tripped twice when i was standing and wanted to turn around. like, i'm clumsy overall and i sometimes trip or bump onto things, but never so often. also, when handing the change to the customer (i'm a student but i work part time as a cashier) i dropped a coin twice. or when he asked me for certain cigarretes, i grabbed the blue instead of red ones etc. after the day of overall lack of concentration i started googling and i found that brain tumor may cause clumsiness, loss of concentration, balance etc. i had a ct scan done 4 years ago due to head trauma but it was clear. however, i've read that tumors can grow fast. should i go to doctor or observe myself for couple days? i've never head headaches as well.

"terrified of colon cancer hi everyone,

i'm in full blown panic attack right now and i can't function properly because of it. i've practically convinced myself i have colon cancer. my symptoms are:

- blood while defacating (especially while constipated, but when i'm not i sometimes feel my anus hurt and see the blood on the paper then)
- diarrhea, constipation
- pain on the right side of abdomen for over a year now, it comes and goes, now it's mostly in my upper back
- extreme fatigue 
- i've had black stool once, but it was after drinking red wine so i thought then that's the cause

i'm also scared the cancer is already in my bones/spine, as my back often hurts and i can feel some kind of ""dent"" in my spine. 

i'm also diagnosed with severe anxiety (duh), so sometimes it's hard to tell which symptoms are real :( for example my fiancee tells this ""dent"" in my spine it's just my muscles contracting because of my anxiety. the same can be said about diarrhea, fatigue... but then again, how do i know when it's anxiety and when it's real?

i know i should just wait for the colonoscopy in 4 weeks, but i can't function properly right now. i've made mistake and visited a forum for colon cancer survivors and not only they all have symptoms similar to mine, but lot of them were very young, like me. 

my doctor told me it's probably ibs and hemorrhoids, but my mom had colon cancer at 50 and i've read it's getting more and more common in young people and here i am, crying myself to sleep every night, because i'm convinced i'm dying. what should i do?",Anxiety,290

"unsettling feelings im feeling something hard to describe and a bit numb. i assume it has to do with anxiety, because of my breathing patterns and overthinking. 

it's triggered very easily by the confrontational tone my mom takes sometimes, it's lately about a sensitive topic. she assumes my feelings and it feels like she's arguing with me about things where there's no need to argue, because im literally just telling her how im feeling bad about the things i did wrong in my relationship and such, and she's arguing about why i keep feeling this way about it and keep blaming myself for a lot of it. she says things about my ex that i don't know how to feel about. things like ""her life is negative and all over the place anyway and she dragged you into it"" and all that. 

i feel like when she argues with me about my feelings it's a form of gaslighting. 

i had been doing progress recovering from hating myself and seeing things more objectively concerning the relationship. 

i always feel like im pretending whenever im not doing well or when i intentionally try to get better. i never perceived i had real struggles in life. in therapy, i saw that i did have things to deal with invisibly with my family. i had set, for the last few days, on the road for feeling more authentic with myself and people around me. i felt the breakup was an obvious hurdle that i can make use of for growth without feeling pretentious about overcoming things, because of how it forced me to rethink things about myself while validating why they're there to begin with.

mom's argument for the relationship is just that my ex was a very negative person who's carelessly trying to gatekeep me. i spiralled so hard after a tough breakup conversation where i saw it wasnt true. i hated how i couldve been convinced of that too. i hate the person it made me. i hate how in my head i was throughoit the whole relationship, and mom contributed to that. im too impressionable with mom.

somehow, these things are linked now that i write without inhibitions. i guess i'll just keep writing until this feeling of emptiness passes. 

but i was starting to like myself more as of yesterday. she doesnt know how much this approach of hers affects me! i was starting to feel like a more genuine and stoic person.

diarrhea. blood in stool. heart palpitations . i think i lost weight too. exhaustion. vomiting. after googling these symptoms it turns out to be colon cancer . i'm so scared right now . i've never been this worried before and  i can't visit the doctor until next week , anything would help .",Anxiety,203

only meds i've tried is low grade anxiety meds. and i'm unsure what bloods. my doc ran more thursday, said he'd call if anything was different. they tested for that one thing that starts with a t that checks for damage in the heart or recent ha's. 
and during the echocardiogram my hr was 130. she noted it was fast but then 2 weeks later i get a call. holter didn't show anything super concerning and the echo was fine. i am under tons of anxiety and stress but whatever is going on has had me bed ridden with neck pain, dizziness, headaches and heart discomfort . the fast hr and pounding feeling for literally months essentially with no breaks. my entire life has been halted because i can't do anything. i take a shower and my heart goes a million miles an hour and my blood pressure goes to the 140's over 90. brain fog and dizziness. tinnitus like crazy and this weird whooshing sound and pain from my neck .
it all started with going to the doctor bc i had thunderclap headaches after orgasm, which lasted everytime for 2 weeks then just stopped. then i started feeling worse and that stopped but all this started. i've had an echocardiogram, several ekgs from the er visits, an mri 3 months ago no contrast, a ct with contrast of my chest and neck last month, a ct with contrast of my head last week. noone can find anything. only suggestion my doc had thursday was potentially icp and he looked worri3d that's what it was and said if i get a headache go to the er. which i did 2 days ago to which they didn't do bloodwork but they did a ct and xray . tested my eye movement . then gave me a shot and sent me home. 
i obviously need to continue to see my doctor and will. just 4 months of this i'm trying to reach out for things to recommend to my doctor to test for and try because they're struggling hard. the only things i can even think of personally anymore is craniocervical instability, anxiety, and maybe clogged artery issues. with the icp he thought, which is phesable i have 95 percent of the symptoms but the numerous head cts and the mri showing no pressure(doesn't rule it out) and the fact that it's been 4 months since it all began and i've not stroked out or anything makes it seem not entirely sure for me personally. but i'm not a doc, ill continue to do what they tell me, but man if i can i wanna try to nudge them the right way",Stress,457

the biggest irony of the lamo experience is that i suspect if i were to keep taking it, i could have found a way to live with the hair situation. i cannot afford a good wig. i make 16.00 an hour. i have no self esteem to draw upon in this regard, so my np okayed me to drop it and start trileptal, which she said might work for me like lamo seemed to.

"distrust of doctors and diagnoses - how to overcome? i've had quite severe health anxiety for a few years. it's hopped from one malady to another, and medical counsel/tests do not assuage it as i'm always convinced they've missed something.

most recently it's cancer - at first lymphoma, now cancer in general. i've visited specialists, gps, had chest xrays and bloodwork, and finally a full ct scan with contrast. despite the all clear in each instance, i spend a debilitating amount of energy on the anxiety they've missed something. each diagnostic procedure seems to buy me a few weeks of calm before the terror and doubt returns.

i do not have systemic symptoms of cancer and am in apparent good health save mild diagnosed gerd -- but compulsive google'ing assures me many healthy people in their early 30s are diagnosed with terminal cancer out of the blue, after numerous misdiagnoses etc. that gerd must be stomach cancer, the lymph node that swelled after a dental infection must be lymphoma, the doctors are brushing me off, the medical system in korea is inadequate, the medical system in australia is inadequate (i've carried this pattern through the doctor's offices of three nations!)

i recognize the compulsive and anxious biases i'm operating on here, but i don't know how to change them. for those who have endured something similar - how do you learn to trust the doctors' ""all clear""? how do you trust that you would probably show some obvious symptoms in case of serious illness, and those symptoms would be correctly interpreted?

"pulsatile tinnitus so over the last week or so i've noticed that for about 10-15 seconds each day, i've heard a pulsing sound in my ear that sounds like a fan whirring. at first i thought it was an external sound, but then i pinned it down to coming from inside my head when i was in the bathroom one time. i googled it and it came up with pulsatile tinnitus, and it said the cause could be tumours, aneurysms, high blood pressure, hearing loss etc. 

i hear it in my right ear, and as i said it's normally for around 10 seconds a day at random times. i've been unable to trigger it or find a way to induce it; there seems to be no pattern to it. which is odd because people who mention this talk of it being constant.  

i exercise regularly and do cardio, and i'm cutting down on my caffeine consumption to see if that helps. i've heard this can be a symptom of anxiety or can just be heightened awareness of my own body, which makes sense but don't exactly know what that means. you'd think i'd have noticed this before.

"thinking about skipping graduation? i am a little sad that i have to post on this sub again. i suffered from depression since high school. when i was in college, i saw a therapist, which really helped. i thought my depression was finally gone for good. but 3 years later (graduating from a community college), my therapist (another one) just helped me realize i still have depression. for a long time, i have mistaken it for anxiety, but depression made more sense. i feel so sad right now, i am dealing with a lot. i know the core of my depression and am fighting it. 

anyways, my graduation is next month in april, and i don't feeling like celebrating. i don't want to go. i think i am worthless and not worth celebrated for. i think i don't deserve love, i don't like it when my family celebrates me, i just don't feel like it, i don't deserve all that love and happiness. i am scared. it overwhelms me.

i am aware that i am talking to myself very negatively. with everything (job, relationships, school,...) that is happening right now, i can't put more eggs in my basket, i really don't wanna deal with my graduation now, i have too much going on already.

i just needed to rant about this.",Depression,221

"got a bloodtest, scared to hear about leukemia. i've posted this in r/askdocs but i just wanted to hear more. sorry. i'm seeking as much support as i can that isn't from people close to me because i don't want to scare them too.  

i'm a 18 year old female living in canada. 5'9, 60kg, half chinese half russian.

i have always had pretty good health for my entire life, so such a sudden change in health is scaring me to death. for the last week, my skin suddenly changed. i have never really bruised, no matter how hard i would hit my knee on something no bruise would ever appear. my family always joked about how even if i fell off a building i'd be completely fine since my skin was ""so thick.""

for the last week, i've noticed weird changes in bloodclotting. i pick at my acne sometimes (gross, i know) and it would be fine the next day; however, suddenly now when i wake up, i see a huge blood scab and bruising around a small white head i picked at the night before. it made me look diseased but i brushed it off as something silly.

then my legs and arms started having weird red dots all over, paired with bruising in odd places like the middle of my thigh where i would never get hit or hurt. it isn't a rash, and my doctor appointment confirmed today that it wasn't a rash too.

not only were my legs and arms covered in these red speckles but my chest, upper belly, and my gums were too. the days before i was surprisingly out of breath. i was out with my friend and constantly needed to sit down after a couple minutes of walking. even in the bus, i was extremely uncomfortable with standing and would squat in the middle if there were no chairs because i could not stand to stand. my friend joked about it and so did i as i usually would walk quite fast and wanted to go everywhere. such a sudden change left her a bit weirded out too.

i finally decided that i was freaked out enough to go in a walk-in clinic. the doctor said it might be hemophilia and sent me to get my bloodchecked. now i'm waiting anxiously at home and can't get the thought out of my head. i know it's useless to be afraid and think about it but i've never had such a sudden health change in my life. as i'm typing this i feel strange little zaps in the joint of my right hand. i haven't really told my friends and definitely not my parents as i don't want them to worry.

all i can do is wait.

"neuroscience of bipolar i am a total hopless nerd. what helps me probably the most with bipolar (besides meds, duh) is understanding what the medications actually do. i have binders full of detailed notes i take on different classes of psychopharmaceuticals (its so fascinating how people with different brain chemistries react so differently to various meds!). for some reason the chemical perspective helps me understand it all so much better. it also helps to explain it to normies, i've found! and with work i've done on emotional awareness it feels like i can tell when something is emotional versus caused by brain chemicals (of course there is overlap).

after things like exercise, sex, caffeine, anything that gets them neurotransmitters moving i feel hyper aware of my chemical state. i can feel the the fall and the rise. 

...it's just when i let my chemicals get so off balance that i get manic or depressed and then this logical view is fucked. lol.

i work from home. and i've done a lot on our current project over the course of this past year. but now that we're sitting near the finish line, almost ready to go-live with not much else to do other than wait for the cutover, i can't help but feel some kind of guilt like i'm not doing enough. even though i helped our team make a ton of progress in the past few months. 

with friends or family it often comes in the form of ""should i be there?"" or ""i know i be there, be present, but i really don't want to"" and then i just feel like a pos terrible friend/sibling/son/etc. for not doing it. for example, a relative of mine had a gender reveal party a few weeks ago. naturally, i didn't go. i'm not particularly close with this family member and haven't been for years. nonetheless i still felt like an asshole for skipping. especially later when i talked to my dad and asked how it went;  i asked ""who was there?"" and he said ""just about everyone. except for you"". i don't think he intended to make me feel guilty, but it kind of did. my mom corrected him later and pointed out a few other family members that didn't make it, but nonetheless i felt like i didn't do enough. even though, again, this relative having the child and i don't really talk or show interest in one another's lives anymore. 

another example is a friend, a close friend, who really does their best to help me get out of the house and do things. they'll invite me to things at bars or restaurants, and 9 times out of 10 i don't go. part of me appreciates the hell out of that, because i need it, and it's nice to be included/wanted. another part of me wishes they'd leave me alone; because i don't think i'm interesting enough or worthy enough to hang out with. then i start feeling a whirlwind of guilt and shame for bailing out of the request.

"i have been seeing this girl off and on since the start of the pandemic (m43). i wanted a relationship, but she was going through a nasty separation and she did not. for the past six months, we have been going out as friends, and i was ok with that. we were supposed to go out right before july 4th and she cancelled last minute. i got upset because i was really looking forward to it and she had a habit of cancelling last minute. i got upset and she stopped communication with me. she said she was busy, and she probably was, but i keep running scenario after scenario through my head of what was going wrong.i have struggled with depression for almost 30 years and have never been able to seek treatment. i have come to the conclusion that this is why i cannot start any meaningful relationship. it is the self doubt and self sabotage that prevents me rounding the corner. i sent her a long text confessing my depression to her and telling her that all i wanted was for her to try and understand what i am going through. i emphasized that our relationship would never be the same and that the only other person who knows about my condition is my doctor. we had constant contact almost every day for the past year and half. she was going through a nasty custody battle with her ex husband, and i was there for her. i was hoping she would be there for me. instead, she has blocked me on every social media platform and my number. it would have met so much to me if she tried to understand, but she cut me off. i am so embarrassed and feel so low. i just want someone to show me some compassion! now she must think i am a creep.the only good news is that i have made an appointment with a therapist for next month. i feel so low and embarrassed right now",Depression,338

"loss of appetite for over a month i believe i got the flu right on christmas day, most likely caused by eating extremely spicy popcorn which i have been eating somewhat frequently prior. went to the er about 4 days after and got nothing but laughs from the doctor saying there's nothing wrong. been eating nothing but rice porridge and shredded pork for over a week. i could hold food down but have completely lost the urge to eat since, would occasionally eat out to try and care for my hunger pangs that i think i was having. at first it was difficult to eat or even will myself to eat, got better, then got worse again. at this point, i could hardly eat and have to seriously think about whether or not i am hungry since it's seemingly impossible to tell when it was as easy as a stomach growl before then. 5-6 days ago, i think i got food poisoning, now i absolutely can't eat anything. got the flu shot maybe 2 days prior and things only seemed to get worse then. would often puke but wouldn't see food come back out, mostly what looked like saliva (had nothing but rice porridge after all). went to the doctor's office and was prescribed ranitidine, the medication may have cause this sense of looming nervousness but it's most likely just me since i've been fine with it every other time after about the second day of taking it or so. decided that it was now necessary to force feed myself to jumpstart my appetite along with light walking (1-2 miles after each meal or so, i wasn't physically active at all prior, worse since i was bedridden during the flu). i fear that i'm overeating when i've been told to eat 5-6 small meals each day, i've also grown terribly impatient with my recovery seeing as how this has been going on for over a month. i would often feel incredibly miserable and every day i was plagued with anxiety until i decided to force feed myself, i don't care about getting fat anymore, i just want my appetite back, but now i'm starting to fear that i'm going about this the wrong way. the feelings of hopelessness and anxiety have hardly gotten better and while i don't suspect my loss of appetite is due to my anxiety, i can never be too sure. the whole reason why i even had anxiety in the first place was because of how sudden my loss of appetite was, and how i was unable to self diagnose myself since i felt no abdominal pain whatsoever, i'm at a loss as to what's going on with my body.

"i had a really bad interaction with my psychologist. she was the first one i went to after a series of bad experiences with different psychologists. i was so afraid to see a new one because if i did and it went badly, it felt like there would be no hope left. but the day i decided to see her was the day after the closest i would ever come to suicide. it was after some emotional experiences that left me feeling like i could not go on anymore. i did not want to hurt my mom so i reached out for help. i saw this woman for nearly a year but recently her response to my suicidal thoughts was downright unprofessional and hurtful. she reprimanded me and told me to think about what my suicide would do to her. and she set up these ridiculous rules that any time i mentioned even a thought of suicide or self harm the first thing she would do is call my dad. mind you i am in my 20s. she had no right to break my patient confidentiality like that. when i told her that if she set that rule, i just would not talk to her about such feelings which would make it much harder to reach out for help. she basically did not care. she was the first psychologist who did not dismiss my feelings. when i told her i felt so bad that i needed to be hospitalized, she sent me to a psychiatrist who was incredibly dismissive of my feelings and then made a change to my meds that included quitting the meds i would been on for 2 years in three days. i felt awful. and i felt like i lost all trust for that psychiatrist. this is not my first experience with mental health professionals and they have basically all been bad. i do not know what to do anymore. i feel like i am at my rope's end. all i think about is death to the point where i feel unable to hold a normal conversation. it consumes me. i have no filter either so i feel like the only way to save others from hearing these awful thoughts is to stop talking to them. i feel alone. i feel like a burden. i know i am a burden. and i do not know if i want to live anymore. i do not know if i want help anymore if this is what help looks like. a bad experience with a psychologist",Depression,427
"this might be downvoted to hell, but i truly do not care anymore. i also struggle with mental health, but probably suffers to a lesser extent.he has expressed multiple times he does not want to get help, despite me repeatedly asking him to. he always says self-deprecating shit like how worthless he is and how he has no friends, which hurts my feelings because am i not a friend? i do my best to be there for him but it. is. exhausting.i met up with old classmates i have not seen in awhile, and i felt like a weight was lifted over my head. i did not have to worry about if i was triggering anyone with what i said. i did not have to listen to them hate on themselves. i realized a lot of times, conversations with my depressed friend sucked the fucking soul out of me.yesterday i did not respond to his online messages because i wanted to keep this happy feeling a little longer. today i woke up to him saying he wanted to k*ll himself and lamenting how hard it is to get the things necessary. i want to scream at him for being so fucking inconsiderate about how this might trigger me. all the nice feeling i was riding on just plummeted. now i am stuck worrying about him and if hell make it till tomorrow. i wish i can tell him to find another person to lay his problems to. i wish i can tell him the things he says bums me out, to say the least. i wish i can tell him being around him makes me feel worse. but what kind of friend would i be?these things will probably hurt his feelings, and maybe drive him over the edge, which i would never ever want to do. but i am just so sick of it. so sick and tired. i am sick of my depressed and suicidal friend",Suicidal,327

"long story short, i have (23f) been feeling very low recently. i have struggled with mental health issues in the past, but nothing that has ever properly affected life to the point of wanting to just disappear. i work 40 hours a week, the usual. i have a long distance boyfriend who i have been with for almost 3 years; very happy with him etc. i do enjoy my job for the most part, which i am very lucky to have. over the last month, i have realised i am just not myself. have been feeling incredibly low, agitated, just generally like life is pointless and i am never going anywhere. i hate this as i am not a sad person and normally can get myself out of a rut. i have been distancing myself from my friends and just staying home as much as i can, as its the only place i feel completely safe and somewhat happy. i received news today that my partner is being deployed to a different country and i will not be able to see him for 6 months. this has completely broke me and sent me over the edge. i found out in work this morning and have been a mess ever since. i work in an office alone (covid) so none of my coworkers can actually tell i am a mess. but even though this news could be the reason i am so sad, it would not explain how sad i have felt recently and how i have reacted. i am genuinely just at a loss, terrified i am going to feel like this forever. terrified to go to the doctors, as they have never taken me seriously. terrified to tell my boss as i feel like he will not take me seriously. i guess i am just looking for some advice on what/where/who to go to? am i depressed?",Depression,318
"i have been thinking to myself almost daily (general suicidal thoughts happen by the hour, but this general line of thought pops up less) that ill have offed myself by next year for about 7 years now. its kind of a strange/funny attitude to have (about as funny as thinking about suicide can be). ehh fuck it i will not brush my teeth, if they go bad ill have killed myself by then.sorry if this comes off as too lighthearted, i just do not have the drive to express how shitty i feel. anybody else just postpone their suicide for years?",Suicidal,101
"so my roommate is one of my best friends and has been for some time. today she told me she feels like she cannot talk to me about things because when i express my annoyance to her about not cleaning up after herself, it hurts her feelings. i can totally understand where she is coming from and i am trying to do better, but its hard. i have been telling her for some time that i expect her to clean up after herself in common areas after a reasonable span of time (several hours to a day). this means cleaning the kitchen after cooking, throwing out old food in the fridge, vacuuming the dining room if the floor is dirty, cleaning up the ash from her bong (she self medicates with weed instead of going on antidepressants and seeking therapy), etc. it just feels like i am the only one making an effort to clean and she only cleans if i ask her to. the problem is, she says that executive functioning like cleaning is extremely difficult for her because she has depression and adhd. i can sympathize with her because i have ocd and mood regulation issues, but i have no trouble keeping the common areas clean and prefer to do so. i just cannot be the only one doing it. i have tried explaining to her that i love living with her, but its just frustrating being the only one who makes an effort to keep things clean. she takes this as me calling her lazy and disgusting, even though i have never called her those things. she has this idea that everyone secretly hates her and will grow tired and abandon her, and me being annoyed at her not cleaning is just a sign this is true. what can i do to make doing household chores easier on her, aside from just doing them for her? i want to continue living with her, but i cannot be her maid. help with a depressed roommate",Depression,337
"i should be happy, i have a supportive family and a decent job. but throughout my life i have struggled with severe anxiety and depression, and every decision, big or small, completely consumes me, sometimes for weeks. and because i overthink and lead with my emotions, i often make poor choices which leads to more anxiety and crippling regret. when i get good advice, i ""think"" myself out of it. i do not enjoy anything because my stomach is always in knots and my brain is on constant replay of what ""could have been"" had i done things differently. the only reason i carry on is because i have responsibilities to others and do not want to screw that up. i have tried talk therapy and some medication but the relief is temporary at best. i know this is wrong and completely non-productive, but i just cannot seem to break out of this self-destructive pattern. i make bad decisions and am consumed by regret",Depression,164

"i feel like i'm subtly giving up and i can't stop background: i'm bipolar 2. i'm a 42 year old man. in addition to the bipolar, i'm autistic and have been severely abused throughout my life. my wife left me suddenly and with no warning after 15 years of marriage. i'm still in love with her despite her cheating on me twice. i blamed myself, but it doesn't change anything. she also left me with both of our kids, who i love a lot, they're 10 and 15. we've decided to slow date again, and see if we can actually be together, but she's already saying it's hopeless before the first date. yeah, i know, it's a really bad sign, but i have to try for me.

now: i can't stop sobbing all the time. like hard, hurt sobbing. i'm in therapy and i'm on meds. i'm not actively suicidal, but i am starting to worry that i might be slipping into a suicidal trance. i think about it daily and i keep pushing the kids into my brain to stop it. i don't really have anyone to talk to because of the aforementioned marriage, there's a lot there and a lot of people would tell me don't give her a second chance, including my 15 year old. i feel so fucking stupid for still loving her despite the harm she's caused me. but let's get back on subject. today, when i was signing out of work on slack i typed ""bye"" to my boss unconsciously, i've never done that before, it's always been, ""see you monday,"" or something else. i held my 3 cats each in turn today and just wept and hugged them. i wandered around the house (i work from home) after work and just felt melancholic and went into each of the rooms and thought about memories in that room. i don't know what my brain is trying to get me ready for, but i'm scared of myself right now. i can't really talk about it out loud to too many people because if the divorce goes forward i might lose custody of the kids because of it, even though they've both said they want to be with me and she is the one who left. so here i am. i don't know what is happening, i'm scared and i have no where to really turn at the moment.",Bipolar,403

"so here we go. i am 27 and a half, never had a girlfriend who was not online, never kissed a woman, never even hugged a woman besides my mom. never had any of these experiences, it is been eating away at me for 13 years now, i have tried to cope and just live with it but it is just getting worse and worse. i have been to over 30 different therapists, none of them could help me. i am broke and since i live in the one place in my country where prostitution is legal, hookers here cost at minimum $250/10 mins plus i have to pay for the hotel and transportation. i have no money, i cannot drive, i am basically worthless. porn has become boring to me now, i got into cyber roleplaying but that is become a dead end now, nobody's interested in me. on the rare occasion i do meet a woman they either tell me i am too ugly or that i am boring and then ghost me. hell, i got texted from a girl last night and it seemed legit but then she asked for my bank account information and i knew it was a scam. all i get are scammers and bots. i have started having dreams now where i meet women but then i wake up and realize nothing has happened. i got so desperate i started going on personals sites and posting ads just asking if any women would just let me see them naked. i would take even that at this point, it is pathetic. i know someone is going to say sex and all that is not important, and i know you are right, this is not because i care what others think. this makes me feel bad about my own self-worth. i feel like i have not been able to experience something people half my age have already experienced. i am constantly surrounded by people who lost their virginities in 6th grade, or in high school, or at least long before they were even 21. and i am here, approaching 30, do not even know what a woman feels like. hell just yesterday my mom was telling my grandfather about my former stepsister getting married to a man a year younger than me. i cannot take this any more. i cannot take the dreams, the pretending to grin and bear it every time people talk about their relationship and sexual experiences. it is too much. i am done...i probably sound like an incel...more reason to kill myself. i am going to kill myself next week because i cannot stand being a kissless virgin anymore.",Suicidal,448
"diagnosed with ""anxiety""? is it a real thing or comment about struggles? i got my discharge letter from child mental health services and it had the usual things in. but it then had a paragraph saying ""it's important to note the patients diagnosis of ... and anxiety"" a different psych told me the anxiety is from a different disorder i disagree but still it seems weird i wasn't told or discussed with about it. 

and only ""anxiety"" a close family member has gad and another has social anxiety but never heard of it like how they wrote it. i don't really care what label is put on me for myself but my new mental health team is going to get this letter and prescribe medication/therapy accordingly. as i do really struggle with anxiety i'd like to get help for it but this seems like it's not a legitimate things and just a passing comment.

if it helps they removed eupd from the original psychiatrist and added ""anxiety"" is it just people don't like diagnosing bpd so used this as a substitute? i live in care so although i don't like having the label bpd it does give my support workers different expectations (emotional disregulatuion, abandonment issues, destructive behaviour).

"""people first language"" and being bipolar i had a somewhat irritating encounter with someone recently who lectured me at length about how damaging it is to refer to myself as bipolar and that i should instead refer to myself as ""a person living with bipolar disorder.""  i know that there was a big push for awhile in various health communities to use ""people first language"" (for those unfamiliar here's a [quick and dirty overview](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/pdf/disabilityposter_photos.pdf).

"advice for communicating with psychiatrist? so i've seen this guy on three separate occasions and the first time we met, he seemed very serious about only meeting with me if i stayed compliant with my medication. honestly, i have a problem with doing so because i've been a bit self-destructive and purposely go off of medication to ""feel"" something or to induce mania.

well, after having a particularly bad depressive episode after a particularly bad manic episode that started to become psychotic (seeing shadow people, forming complex delusions, thinking my assailant is after me again), i'm struggling to figure out how i'm going to talk to him about dumping my seroquel down the toilet.

truth be told, like i've read many others say, seroquel makes me feel dead. it helps regulate sleep, but i hardly function in the day and it does a damn good job of making me in a continual depressive state. i told him when he tried to re-prescribe it to me the first time i met him after being out of the psychiatric hospital ... and he didn't listen to me or take me seriously when i told him it makes me suicidal. :c

so now that i broke my promise of not taking my seroquel, idk how to communicate to him that i don't trust him. he didn't even refill my lithium after we first met, so i was rapid cycling all of february. i feel like an emotional train wreck and the seroquel helped me crash from my manic episode last week, but this depressive episode this week was god awful.

should i just find a new psychiatrist if i don't feel like he is helping me and i don't trust him? being on medicaid makes my life more difficult. if it helps, i have type i with psychotic features and ptsd.

thank you in advance for helping. i've found this subreddit so supportive and not knowing anyone with bipolar disorder, i don't feel as completely out of my mind seeing so many similarities to other people with my diagnosis. i appreciate you all!",Bipolar,350

"believe me i know this is the least of everyone is worries right now compared to real problems. this is just mainly for everyone saying they cannot really enjoy video games anymore.if you are feeling depressed about not having fun with / enjoying video games as much as you used to, try not to think about the now. try to remember why you enjoyed and/or fell in love with them. is it because of how pretty or cool they can look? is it because of the immersive / compelling storytelling? is it because of having attachments to certain characters? is it because they inspire you due to certain morals (again storytelling)? is it because they do actually teach you some things, including skills you do not even think about? or is it because they are just flat out fun?or maybe if you are like me, it is all of the above + they make you feel like you are escaping from life in a sense. like you are being immersed in a different world that you enjoy more than the one you have. admittedly that is not always a good thing, because it can distract you from things you need to do if you are not careful. or you might get too immersed into it that you feel a disconnect from reality. believe me i have felt that plenty of times.anyways the point is it is alright to get immersed into games or any other form of media really because you like it better than your current life. and maybe life is really hectic or joyless for you that it is hard to remember those fun feelings. of course it works better for some games then others but hey. just remember that that is just one reason to keep existing and enjoy video games in general :) for anyone not getting enjoyment from video games anymore",Depression,316

"tips on finding employment after quitting job due to bp? this is all very hypothetical for myself, but i'm hoping others reading have insight. i am in the us.

i'm in a job that often triggers me for various reasons. i've been in a almost constant depressive episode for the past almost two months. the exception is some hours of natural ease/happiness from spending time with a few nonjudgmental friends throughout that time. my work performance has tanked and it's becoming an issue. i have coworkers talking to my boss about it, and i don't blame them, but my boss is trying to be nice about it to a degree that makes me worry that i'm taking his reputation.

i will be doing an out-patient treatment program in the next few weeks. i am already on intermittent fmla, but the current plan (which i do not like much) is to do part-time work in the afternoons at my current job while i do the program in the mornings.

i just had an anxiety attack after getting a phonecall from my boss to talk about it. i feel like the end is near, but my boss and a few coworkers are still trying to be on my side and i see that. however, i need to leave sooner or later. i used references to get this job (i've been in it for just under a year) that were absolutely glowing from people i respect. quitting is embarrassing for me and i wonder how much it will reflect on them. i don't feel comfortable using them as references any more. i have a long job history on my resume, with a new job about every three years. but i think it will look weird if i don't use anyone from those jobs as references.

my main question is:
assuming i don't have references, how do i find a job? 

i'm 30, i live alone because i have a hard time with roommates. i know i can be ""the problem,"" but i always try to resolve any conflict and the older i've gotten the better i've gotten, but i also am in a difficult place emotionally and am having a hard time focusing and functioning. i feel like i'm at the edge and yet there's a light at the end of the tunnel of treatment if i can just figure out how to do this job a little bit longer and find something else that can help me keep my home and continue my medications and therapy.

feels like a tall order.

tl;dr: assuming i don't have references, how do i find a job as someone in their 30s?",Bipolar,446

"i am an atheist, and i am terrified of death because of two reasons: eternal life, and ceasing to exist. i have a fear of eternal life or heaven, because i do not want to live forever because if you think about it, it is a horrible fate because you will be bored for eternity. i also have a fear of death, because i have extremely close relationships with my friends and a select amount of family members, and i do not want to loose all of my memories of my life and my personality and all of my friends and family that i love. i am also afraid of being afraid of death, because the whole christian religion with heaven is that if you believe in heaven, then you get to go there, but if heaven is really real, and all of my friends and family go there and i am stuck in hell or eternal death,i would loose on an eternity of being with my loved ones, and i would not even know it, but i would spend that whole eternity in fear because i would not even know if it is real or not. now i am kind of just rambling so i am going to stop talking and just ask you this: is there any way to get over this fear? how to deal with the fear of death",Depression,233

i feel insane sometimes. i feel really neurotic, paranoid, insecure, and immature sometimes. when i don't think about memories or people that upset me, i'm fine. these past few months i've been slowly recovering from this horrible depression that's plagued me for a while, but in these past few days it's been returning as i start thinking about these bad memories again.

i feel traumatized and like i'm a victim of something i can't understand. like i'm alone in this pain. the thing is that my ""trauma"" is really just a dozen or so bad interactions i had in my old circle of friends. in particular, there was this one person who i had a handful of unpleasant interactions with. these were mostly brief exchanges that shouldn't have affected me as much as they did, but they felt really, sincerely resentful and unwarranted. what did i do? i didn't know how to stand up for myself, and nobody did for me.

this person lashed out at me, calling me insecure and afraid a couple of times, and said some horrible things about people with my disability. they're ableist and, honestly, that group as a whole was too. not out of malicious intent but ignorance.

this person wasn't wrong, but the way they treated me didn't help. seeing those criticisms mirrored by others a couple of times made me feel even more weak, because i knew i was being talked about behind my back. and when i did eventually see how this person talked about me behind my back, it felt nasty and unwarranted.

still though, it feels so fucking stupid man. i don't know why i let this hurt me. it's been months since i stopped talking to those friends, a few years since those bad exchanges occured, and it still affects me. i never met a person who exhibited such resentment for me in my life, seemingly for no justifiable reason. it really hurt my self-esteem and it still does.

when i think about those friends for too long i start to say things like ""i wanna die"" to myself, like a tic. it's so stupid and i feel like a horrible person for this. for feeling such disproportionate hurt over a dozen or so bad memories. when i don't think about this stuff i begin to feel more ""normal"" again though.

sorry that this is so long but i'm just wondering if anyone can relate. if not, sorry for wasting your time. i hope this isn't considered off-topic since i'm undiagnosed. but yeah, i feel really pathetic about this side of myself. maybe i'm just highly neurotic, i don't know. i just wish i could understand what's wrong with me.",Personality disorder,491

one of the most recent issues that's sending me into a spiral is that i need to do a task that involves leadership and giving directions. but it's difficult for me to communicate. it's as if the words are all sprawled out in my head and whenever i make an attempt at talking, it just comes across as disorganized and incoherent. i'm not a leader. i can't direct. i'd rather follow than lead. 

today was especially horrible because i'm generally a well organized person who has it together, but my classmate ended up seeing how much of a mess i am. after something fell out of my plan, i got flustered, shut down entirely. it's so embarrassing, and now i want to hide from everyone. i don't know how to recover from something like that, or show that i'm better than my anxiety.",Anxiety,231

"psa: steroids and worsening of bipolar symptoms disclaimer: i am not a doctor, so please always consult with yours when you seek medical treatment.

i don't see this talked about enough. it's flu season and many of us may become sick and be prescribed steroids. 

steroids have the chance of worsening bipolar symptoms and may send you into a mixed episode or manic episode or worse. 

if you are prescribed steroids, please mention your bipolar diagnosis with your doctor. 

i'm sure there are cases of bipolar people that have taken steroids and have come out fine afterwards. i'm sure there are cases where a bipolar person is required to take steroids as there are infinite personally specific medical conditions and situations. but ask yourself these questions: have you disclosed your bipolar disorder to the practitioners prescribing steroids? are you stable? are you medicated? do you have the resources to get emergency help should things go wrong? 

i was sick last year and prednisone almost made me kill myself. i had no idea that steroids could make my bipolar disorder worse. i spent over a week in hell as it left my system. apparently, it even awakens bipolar disorder in otherwise stable bipolars. if anyone has any evidence to the contrary or input or experience, please post. 

these might not be the best links, but maybe you guys will find better ones.

all i want to do is die and give the fuck up. but how can i do that to my family? my roommate can't afford rent on her own. my boyfriend will be so sad. my friends will be broken. 

i'm just in a continuous cycle of fucked up shit. it's not worth the good times anymore. like they're great and all, and i use to be able to use that as motivation to go on but now i just don't care.

i'm freaking out and crying in bed right now, but come tomorrow morning i have to hold it together and pretend everything is okay, go to a funeral without breaking down. i'm struggling with fucking spellcheck right now how the fuck am i supposed to deal with a funeral.

i'm going to fucking breakdown and everyone is going to have to deal with that. but we'll be across the country and it's my fucking grandfather's fucking funeral what shit timing. everything is so bad and i want to die i dont even know where i'm going with any of this but i need help.

my plan was just to get high during the trip but now i cant do that. i have to go back to work saturday but i also think i need to go inpatient. but how will my roommate afford rent? how will anything fucking work for everyone else. i should just die and they'll deal with that but then it will be over. no future problems. what the fuck do i do",Bipolar,464

"so i'm in diagnostic phase to see if i have breast cancer and my doctors won't tell me anything. okay so backstory. four (4) weeks ago i found a lump under my armpit. it was hard, fixed in place and didn't hurt. i watched to see if it would go away and it didn't. so i made an appointment with my gp.

when he examined it he found that it was coming off of breast tissue of my right breast and ordered a mammogram and ultrasound which i had wednesday.

they found three lumps in my breast (not including what is under my arm) as well as my lymph nodes being enlarged. the only reason i know this is because i saw this on the ultrasound and asked the sonographer (sp?).

she showed the doctor my results and they recommended a ct scan with contrast and are sending me to a specialist.

i've called to try and get my results from the mammogram/ultra sound but they won't give them to me over the phone (which i understand).

i had the ct scan today and see the specialist tuesday.

"a big move has me stuck in a mixed episode, not sure how to cope. hi, r/bipolarreddit

i just moved back home to be with my family for the next 6 months and i'm trying to figure out how to cope until getting to my new pdoc. 

surprisingly i have been stabilized on only 12.5 mg of lamictal (extremely rare-- my body is intensely sensitive to meds, substances, etc.) for the last couple of months. my day to day routine was rather consistent though, so there wasn't that much to throw me off. it's helped more so with my co-morbid bpd mood swings.

but after an 11 hr stressful care ride, change of environment, change of sleep schedule, and moving away from my boyfriend? i'm lost. i'm waking up in a deep depression, don't want to shower, don't want to eat. then when my loud and boisterous family gets me out of the house i start feeding off of their energy and won't stop talking, become obnoxious at restaurants, speed home, racing thoughts and sweating like crazy, stay up all night, then repeat the next day. luckily i haven't been doing anything too extreme (yet) but i don't know what to do in the meantime, even right now i feel panicked and sweaty and confused yet worn out and can't find the will to do anything. not to mention i've been feeling intensely lonely even though i am near my family. 

i start work on monday, which i'm hoping can add in some needed structure to my day, but at the same time i'm nervous to be adding another facet of change to my life and sending me down more of a spiral. 

i want to get out and distract myself during this weird state but i really can't find the footing and i'm afraid if i stay around my family i'll get worse.

"just have to get this out female, 33 years old, bmi 23 

april 2017 i got a cough/cold.  i continued coughing on and off for months, mostly in the morning, no other symptoms (ie no weight loss, no fatigue).  in october, after several months personal upheaval i managed to go to the doctor who sent me for a chest x-ray just to rule out an infection.  chest x-ray comes back with what the radiologist says could be a chest infection so it's recommended that i take antibiotics.

i take a week of amoxicillin, on the 4th day i start getting a rash on my hands and feet which starts creeping up my limbs on the following days.  i call my dr who recommends that we switch to a different antibiotic (sorry, don't remember which one it was).  i take that for a week.  after the course is over i'm still coughing, mostly in the morning.

i go back to my dr who sends me for another chest x-ray which comes back with no indication of infection and then my dr sends me on to a respiratory medicine specialist.

respiratory medicine dr orders blood tests, chest ct scan and a breathing test.  blood tests have come back with borderline high levels of igm and i am freaking out about what this means.  no results from anything else yet.  

respiratory medicine dr thinks i have reflux and has put me on 40mg of an acid reducer.   at no point did she say she thinks i have any signs of anything life threatening.  

i'm just so scared.  i've always been a hypochondriac, and i am finding it really hard waiting for the results from all these tests.

"i felt motivated today and decided to write this; my therapist told me a while ago that one seemingly small, useless step, is still a full step! and i thought this was actually really comforting advice. so let me explain:we often compare ourselves to others. other people who might be very active, have intense social life, big dreams or the perfect job. they might live healthy and have energy to exercise and it seems like they have everything under control every single day. to someone with depression, this seems impossible to 'compete' with. for someone with depression, something as simple as getting out of bed and washing yourself, may seem exhausting. social interactions on a bad day? no thank you, do not have the energy. **so try to look at situations this way; one small step is still a full step.** making your bed instead of doing chores all day, is still one made bed! eating one meal instead of starving yourself, is still a full meal!brushing your teeth when you do not feel like taking care of yourself, is still an important part of personal hygiene!! having one productive/good day in a bad week, is still a full productive day! on a bad day, make a list of your accomplishments. and do not think ""i only did one thing."" think ""yes i did this whole thing!!"" or ""you know what... atleast i did xxx."" be kind to yourself, because depression is a bitch who already makes your life hard enough. do not compare yourself to others, only compare them to yourself if you had not taken that step today! i hope this might give you a tiny bit of power to make that step. i hope i did not break any of the subreddit rules, please let me know if i did.

i've tried, i caught up with old friends, made some new ones, actually have some hope for the future for the first time in a long time, even been trying to get a girlfriend (i'm 22 and have never had one). turns out my health anxiety hates this, i'm not allowed to be happy because to be happy is to be excited for the future, something that's hard to do when your thoughts are once again racing with things you thought you had moved past. why would i go out to the bar with friends if i'm dying, why am i mixing up words when typing, why is my leg suddenly jerking frequently, why am i even feeling motivated and confident, is this finally the personality changes that come with having a brain tumour. anxiety is cruel but this is the cruelest thing it has done yet, preventing my ability to be happy because what's the point, i'll obviously be dead soon.

"i had the messiest life for so long. i have been diagnosed with a plethora of things over the last year. i treated myself so horribly and was so casually suicidal in everything i did for so long. i was doing way too many drugs, letting other people use my body, and trying to do anything reckless to maybe die that night. just about two years ago, i had a breakthrough. i started liking myself more, set up two incredibly strong and supportive friendships, begun seeing the best therapist i have ever talked with, and started the most stable and healthy relationship i have ever been in.since march i have gotten bad again. all i want is to die and stop experiencing all the flashbacks from trauma and the fervent self hatred. my friends and boyfriend have all verbally confirmed they love me and want to help. even my parents have agreed to see someone over the last year and are trying to heal some serious childhood trauma. everyone wants to help. everyone says they love me. i simply cannot believe them. i have felt the exact same for so long. when i have had nothing and no one, and when i have absolutely everything. i think i just might be too damaged and used to being sad to ever feel happy. no matter how good things get, i feel like i want out. i should have no reason to feel like this",Suicidal,243

"chicken or the egg? discussion! hi everyone! 

i have a question that has been occupying my mind for a long time, and i hope that this will spark a discussion and we can get deeper into understanding bipolar and find some answers. maybe some of you are wondering the same.

the question: mostly during manic episodes when my mind is racing at an alarming pace i wonder if this is all caused after all by external factors that make me stressed out or by the bipolar itself, so from within. like, i'm starting to stress out because a situation occurs that is out of my control: turmoil in a relationship, some annoying interactions, things at work etc. or i start stressing out because of a shift towards manic?

 this is where i'm lost: at times i think that because of the diagnosis i overthink the stress and anxious feelings; knowing and convinced about my diagnosis i fully inserted bipolar behavior into my own identity and it informs my actions? but we don't live in a sterile bubble, life is life and always something is happening.


for context: 
during my manic state i start pacing, mind racing, increaced heart rate, twitches and intrusive thoughts. i start walking fast through streets almost running away from this, and i end up looking into passerbys eyes and then it's as if i'm being thrown into their lives, as if i live through their experience, i imagine how they act, what happened in their childhood, flashes into their daily routine, interactions, frustrations and happiness. and then i look at a window on some far away building, start imagining and experiencing the life of another person in a similar way.
 then i get thrown back into my body into reality and become more overwhelmed. then it's my own memories of the past, then imagining my own future and so on. 

 
the experience is intense and doesn't stop. when it wears off eventually i regain focus, calm and ability to think clearer. happens periodically about every few months and lasts usually about a week, maybe 2(depending how i deal with it after the peak. it's not the most intense that happened but i don't wanna go in even more details, because this is already tl;dr 

edit: i have been diagnosed by 4different doctors on 4 separate occasions, and rejected that idea for about 7 years until it became too unbearable and i was legit worried that this time i'm definitely not making it through. 


so let's discuss the initial question! would love to hear your thoughts about this chicken or the egg question and gain some insights!",Bipolar,440

"als fear sending my life in a downward spiral. i don't know where to to turn other then to people who may be able to relate to me. every second of the day lately i have it in my head that i am going to pass away from als shortly. 

it all started about 1 - 2 weeks ago. i started having muscle twitches in my right arm and right thigh, and when i bend over to pick something up or when i squat, my right thigh muscles twitch and tremor uncontrollably. a few google searches later, ""als"" is popping up all over the place. it's been a constant worry now with every 5 - 10 minutes me getting up out of my chair to ""test my strength"" in my right leg. but every time i squat or try to balance on my right leg and bend at the knee, the tremors and twitches trigger in my right thigh like crazy. i have really horrible hmo insurance and it takes anywhere from 3-5 weeks for me to see a primary care physician. i have an appointment for 4 weeks from now with my pcp. but until then all i can do is sit back and hope for the best but expect the worst. 

i am in in a massive downward spiral now. i can't do anything but sit on my computer and research als. i don't want to go anywhere or do anything because in my head i want life to move as slowly as possible just incase i have not a lot of time left on this earth. i don't know where else to turn. i am so so so scared.

i am an almost 23 year old trans woman and i live in the south. i transitioned in my teens and have been mentally female as long as i can remember. transitioning has been a blessing but also a curse. gender dysphoria is the something i would not wish on my worst enemy. before transitioning i simply would not label myself anything sexuality wise because being a gay male never felt true to me even though i was assigned male and am attracted to men. i always identified internally as a straight female. i graduated high school online. i tried public school but would stop going because of the bullying and harassment. when i finally transitioned i felt excited and happy but as the years went on the dysphoria got worst and i became more unhappy with myself. my parents divorced when i was 15. i still feel somehow responsible for it party. i always had problems and i always felt the strain it put on my family and parents. i cannot work because my anxiety is so bad i vomit and shake. i feel like every single person that looks at me or knows me is judging me. my two past relationships ended terribly. and i always blame myself and who i am for it. i truly feel unlovable. no matter how many surgeries or hormones i get i feel inadequate and inhuman. nothing i can do elevates my sadness. i want to die peacefully and painlessly. that is what would make it better. transgender female lost,Suicidal,258

my husband woke up at 1am to use the restroom and asked me' ""what the hell are you doing?"" then moved on. i have been hiding this for so long. thinking and planning and trying to figure things out. on my way to work he told me to drop my attitude and i lost it and told him everything. everything i've kept secret for 9 months. i told him my final plan and what i'd done.

he told me to go home or he'd call the police to my work. so i kept on going to work. he's not my master. but i don't want them to take me. i have a degree in psychology and this isn't my first, or fifth run of this. i know what to say to stay out. but this is the first time a family member has called. i don't want to go. it won't help or change how i feel. i have an amazing therapist, psychiatrist, and dr. i'm not emotional or desperate. i just don't want to try every day like this. trying to look and act normal and happy. 

yesterday my husband and mother in law told me i'm doing a shit job covering it. so what's the point anyways? i can't hide it. no one wants to hear it. i told my husband i want his support, but the only thing he will say is he is calling the police.

"contacting an ex about std testing i've been dealing with healthy anxiety, particularly with being exposed to stds (specifically hiv). i've only had sex (stupidly, unprotected) with one guy, an ex from two years ago. i realize what a huge mistake that was and i have since gotten tested for all stds  and tested negative for hiv using the 4th generation test. last time i was tested was aug. 2018. however, i've had a long list of symptoms since the exposure, thus the anxiety. i haven't been able to put the fear and anxiety behind me. there hasn't been a day within the last two years that i haven't thought about having hiv. i understand that the tests are negative and i should believe the results, and i want to. i'm about to start a new stage in my life and need to desperately put this behind me (it's been legitimately driving me crazy). i can't eat, think/focus, sleep nowadays. 

i've come to the conclusion that perhaps the only thing i think would put my mind to rest is reaching out to my ex ( who i had the unprotected sex with) himself. the thing is i haven't talked to him in over a year and have no idea how i would go about talking about this to him. but if an awkward conversation is the price i have to pay for my sanity and control of my life back then i have to do it. how do you suggest i go about this?  do i go straight to the point? i'd suggest him to get tested for confirmation.

"possible misdiagnoses? during the winter of 2016 i was diagnosed with bipolar i, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, ptsd, and a few years earlier adhd. at first i felt that my diagnoses made sense and i was willing to take my meds. while there were times where i accidentally or deliberately didn't take them, i was mostly consistent. i did in fact feel better in time, though there were many ups and downs. the summer of 2017 i felt that my medications were working amazingly. i was productive, holding a job, writing a book, and overall happy. beginning my first year of college even started off well. towards the winter i became very overwhelmed but everyone was due to finals. i expected when our winter break came i would calm down. throughout the break i had very low energy and a few major mood swings. i convinced my boyfriend to go on a road trip to california with me in the span of a few hours. i felt very excited and couldn't stop talking and laughing. once we got there i was back to feeling depressed and unhappy, even more so because i thought going on a trip would help me feel better. i thought maybe the cold weather was what had me down, but the change to warm weather made no difference. when we got back in early january i took it upon myself to go off my meds cold turkey (which i know is not the best thing to do and i don't want to suggest that to anyone else). i expected my symptoms to worsen from withdrawals but nothing really happened. i was slightly more emotional and less zombie like, but nothing major. since then i've only been taking mydayis for adhd and i've felt a lot better than i have in the past five months. i've had relatively normal moods, getting sad when something saddening happens or vice versa. this leaves me extremely confused. is it possible that i don't have the things i was diagnosed with? or could my symptoms just be taking a break? i had extreme mood swings at the time of my diagnoses and even in the summer briefly. i really just want to know if anyone else has experienced this or has any thoughts.",Bipolar,383

as you can imagine, i checked it out. there were actually many articles and case reports regarding it that it kinda scared me. i had been worried specifically about dementia for the past month for a bunch of odd-and-end reasons..and then google relays the term in reference to my hypochondria/anxiety...? it is the coincidence now that is flipping me out and confirming my fear even more. that is some bizarre..not even intentional coincidence, dont you think?

"advice on long-term treatment for a bipolar depressed family member? my brother has had bipolar depression since he was a teenager, he's mid-20s now and still living with our retired father. recently, he ""attempted suicide"" by jumping off a 15-foot balcony and breaking his feet, leading to hospitalization (and inpatient psych). given the background context below, what would you do?

* he has talked about and threatened suicide hundreds of times

* this is the third time he's been hospitalized in the last 90 days (previously for psychosis and suicidal threats)

* each time, he's released after 3-5 days after he begins to act normal and wants to go home

* our father is a psychiatrist who desperately wants to help him, and has not been willing to ""kick him out"" of the house

* he has not been willing to consider longer-term inpatient psychiatric options (i don't know what options are available?) and because he always has had my father's home to return to, the hospital is always able to discharge him

* he has seen at least 20 psychiatrists in the last decade, and taken hundreds of different medications, with zero success

* he has received a year of ect treatment, with significant memory loss and only temporary depression relief

* he dropped out of high school due to a combination of social phobia, depression, sensory issues, and rage issues

* he has never applied for a job

* he sometimes wishes to move into his own apartment, but that gets derailed by his constant suicidal threats, changing his mind about everything, easily becoming frustrated and overwhelmed, and at least for now, he can't even walk...

how do you end a revolving door of 5-day long emergency room and inpatient psychiatric visits? is my father's home being open to him actually hurting his chances of recovery? would being barred from returning home force him to choose between homelessness and long-term inpatient care? my father is in his 60s, and beginning to decline mentally, so i see this situation deteriorating long-term if someone doesn't do something. what would you do?",Bipolar,351

i was talking with my pdoc the other day and i asked about the national parks access pass for people with disabilities and she said something along the lines of i need to decide if i want to be considered legally disabled because that could bite me in the butt one day. 

i know on my job licensing application it asks if i have any conditions that affect my ability to practice veterinary medicine. i said no because i don't think that this disorder will affect my medical judgement. anyway, i will take time off before it gets to that point. but at the same time i might need to take more time off than i have available in my contract if i have breakout episodes. but there is already an example of this potential problem.

"slipping into a ""classic"" depression very weird for me. so it's been years like 15+ years since i've had a depression that was not a mixed episode.   i'd been pretty stable tye past 3 years, but my migraines at least that's what my doctor thinks they wre (had them for years) have been getting worse.   last year i wound up in the er with one so bad that i went from moving under my own steam to get in the door (with the worst pain in my life, made running over my foot with a one story tall steel gate feel like kiddy play) to needing help into a wheel chair cause i couldn't even stand.   

i've had 3 rounds of blood work all normal a ct scan and mri normal.   now an oximetry test tuesday night. (waiting on doctor to interpret the results) and an appointment with a neurologist august 9th (soonest they had) and required taking a personal day off work cause it won't fit well in my work day.  

they've never actually gone away.    even on days i don't record as having one i low-key always have pain, just it's at a threshold tolerable enough i can for tye most part ignore it.   but most days of the week i've got headache and/or the front of my ""brain"" feels like it's being prickled with pins and needles (not in pain those, thats reserved for my temples and the icepicks behind my eyes) it makes my brain mush, and makes me feel physically weak.   but every appointment i have because of that they test for a stroke but i come out normal/no stroke. and my mind is mush it can't think it's way out of a wet paper bag full of holes, heck it will even struggle for forum words.

i just feel so hopeless and empty and broken. like a pathetic, worthless loser and failure at everything,. that i'm not worth shit.   and between tye two i'm always exhausted and don't have the energy or will to do things and even when i force myself i feel like i'm shit at it. but i'm also super irritable and pissy and angry alot.   so much of the time i could scream and shout but cry and beat myself in the head at the same time.   i struggling very hard to use my logic and tools to get out from under all this.",Bipolar,404

"i think i am bipolar and was misdiagnosed with borderline... now what? (uk) hello.  

to cut a very long story short, i believe i am bipolar, but have been misdiagnosed with borderline personality disorder.  my gp says this is likely, and that my treatment so far has been inappropriate because the crisis team are dismissive of people with personality disorders.  so, she has referred me to see the entry-level people who gauge whether i can see a psychiatrist, with a view to be re-diagnosed.  

after that, i am worried about what will happen.  i desperately want some treatment that will work for me, but i've found that bpd is a very ""sticky"" label and professionals often treat me like i am playing the system to try and get sympathy and as if what i say is unreliable.  i am afraid of the psychiatrist thinking i am just shopping for a new diagnosis.  also i have run into a lot of problems in my health care from being diagnosed bpd, does anyone know if i can have that diagnosis removed if it's found to be incorrect?

"i was on a date a couple of weeks ago. i feel awful. he said i reminded him of fiona from shrek. i lost over 30kg now. i weigh 54kg, 1.70m, and i am still fat. he started to poke my belly fat, proceeded to tell me i was still chubby. he pointed out my nose is crooked and that i should consider surgery. why cannot i just be normal.i started to feel better about myself after losing weight. i did. and everything i felt insecure about came back just like that. i went on a walk last night. and i realised that it does not matter. thick or thin. make up, no make up. working hard, hardly working. poor, rich. i am worthless. it does not matter what i do. what i look like. in the end we are all going to die anyway. so i rather die now, while i still have some dignity left. then die when i am old and have faced even more pain. i have tried, and tried and tried",Suicidal,176

"i have been having suicidal thoughts ever since i was like in 5th grade or so because i felt like a burden on my family, friends and just generally anyone i have interacted with. i have had a really hard time with talking to people too, and everyone in my family judges me for it. they are not wrong in doing so but a lot of the times i physically cannot open my mouth and speak. i got a girlfriend around my freshman year in highschool and despite that the thoughts did not go away. i really was happy at times and imagined us living together after getting married and that, but a few years later we broke up. even though she said she did not want to get married i think she is lying to me. she told me that she did not want to get into any relationships until a few years later, only to get into one about a week later. this and other incidents of her lying to me made me more sad than i ever had been. compounding all those other reasons i felt that those years we were together were all a lie which sucks when she could have been the person to pull me out of wanting to kill myself. the suicidal thoughts have gotten to the point to where i am almost always thinking about gruesome ways in which i can kill myself or be killed by others. i have even slipped up and asked my ex to kill me in a begging kind of way. i told her ""kill me"" over and over to her face and i am ashamed of having done that. the thing is, despite all of this i have only cried once in about 3 years and i am certain of that. it was when my ex and i broke up. i do not know why or how this happened but i cannot cry anymore no matter how hard i try. i hurt myself physically and mentally and nothing seems to do it. every thought becomes more and more bloody and that and i even picture my familys reaction to it; nothing. i have become obsessed with trying to make myself cry and i even draw a hypothetical of what my suicide might look like. i will not be killing myself anytime soon because i am catholic and do not want my family to feel bad; the whole shtick. but has anyone else not been able to cry or can you relate to any of this? i cannot talk about this to anyone else but i have some anonymity on here so i felt safe in posting this. thank you. i cannot cry anymore.",Suicidal,457

"new job schedule is triggering my hypomania i have a part-time job on some days where i usually work from 5-9 pm and get home at 10 to go to sleep. but i just started a new full-time 8 am - 4 pm job m-f. because of the distance i have to be at the bus stop around 7 am. i know this is risky, but i really could use the money. (my family was bad with money, so i have ""security issues"" about not having enough cash in the bank.)

the first few days were a little rough because my body wasn't used to the schedule change. getting out of bed was a struggle. but after a few days of that i woke up with the most sublime energy, the kind that begs to be released and shown to the world. my first thought was ""fuck yeah, i'm all better now!"" my thought process is still accelerating to generate all these new ideas. one day i'm going to write essays on my leftist theories on the occult (don't worry, they make sense to me) for some kind of publication and get famous. but i don't have the patience to sit down and read any relevant literature - i just can't go fast enough and i want to throw the book across the room. i've also started another goal to lose weight because i realized i don't need as much ""fuel"" to stay energetic as i thought i did. i think the moment i realized i was hypomanic was the hypersexuality, the symptom i'm most ashamed of, as i'm usually a very disciplined and self-controlled person. i think the major reason why i didn't end up acting on those impulses later that night (i had the night off) was that my back was in a lot of pain and i had to be still (ugh) the rest of the night. god, this is so frustrating. and disappointing.",Bipolar,327

"tendency to shutdown i'm sure i'm not the only one doing this but i find myself shutting down and withdrawing from people and situations to such an extent that i am unable to look them in the eye. it is triggered through different mechanisms but most often than not it is triggered by a situation in which i feel less worthy than what i already am.

i have low self esteem and an extremely negative view of myself. notwithstanding my past having an influence on that view. 

some situations may come across as innocent; suppose you were friends with someone. not direct friends, a friend of your significant other or a friend of a friend. this friend takes interest in you only at times where they are in your company. or having a mental meltdown in my case. they never text. truth be told, they never even ask about you.

another example, people ask you your opinion about something. you give it thinking it may be of use but then it turns out they didn't even bother listening. or they brag to you about a choice they made when you suggested it in the first place. 

you feel like nobody sees you. nobody respects you. nobody listens to you.

i withdraw and i shut down. although i can try and look past it, i can never truly get over it. it adds to my negative outlook on life and it breaks me down further. soon there'll be nothing left to break.

i feel alone; levels that's been elevating over the last couple of years. i don't know if life is truly worth pursuing anymore. any way, don't mind me. just another rant.",Personality disorder,282
"tips on stopping myself from lashing out at people? i've been undergoing a lot of stress as of late from some new developments in my life, and that has led me to lashing out at people, both friends and family, who are either trying to help or just engage in conversation.

i've always been a pretty social guy, introverted but i like going out to see people and i get invited to random functions from time to time, so i take it as a sign that at least some people like my company lol.

its just that when i'm under intense duress like i am now, my immediate instinct is to take as much control as possible, and that can make me agitated and forget that the person i'm talking to/interacting with might not appreciate that i'm coming on strong.

i've never had anger issues, i don't get violent, i just get pretty mean, and that's an ugly part of me that i don't like. i feel like i've already pushed some people away, i would just like to talk about some coping strategies that could help. i already exercise and read often, work full time, and don't really have any responsibilities outside of that if i'm being honest.

i don't know, sorry for a rambly post, i've never really opened up about *personal* and *touchy* feelings like this and even if i don't get real advice, then just putting it into words will help solidify the problem for me.",Stress,250

when everything looks stable to my dad (aparently) the doctors tooks the desicion to send him to our house, and then start to the recovery terapy regime, in the second day, he died, the cause of his dead maybe was due cardiac issues, since then i cant sleep properly, my mind are broken, i can see my dad in my nigthmares, suffering as the days when he was at the hospital, now i have an existencial crisis, i realize that life is so short, also im suffering from health anxiety, i fear to heart diseases, always checking my heart rate, my blood pressure, and when i sleep, in my dreams, i can see my body in a coffin, feeling that im dying or already dead

what can i do guys? i know this is part of the grief, but what can i do for the health anxiety?, i used to smoked weed, since that incident and due the health anxiety everytime when i smoked i experienced full blown panic attacks, i die in my nigthmares, i see my dad suffering in those dreams....

"have diverticulitis, now anxiety? i was diagnosed with diverticulitis in september.  unfortunately, the infection spread through a hernia in my groin area and i developed an abscess in my groin.  i was hospitalized for ten days for treatment.  last time i had been to the hospital was at birth 38 years before, so this was a shock.  i wasn't treated poorly or anything, just being away from my family, from work, from life, seemed to get me down.  i have a five year old and i face time'd with her while in the er the first night and you could see the fear in her eyes.  she had only been in the hospital prior to visit great aunts, who would go on to pass away.  the look on her face is seared in my head and basically impossible to shake.  a fearful look because i'm sure she thought, when i see people in the hospital, i some times don't see them much longer after that.

it was a bit of a tough recovery, every ache, spasm, etc sent me into a panic.  feeling my groin to see if i could feel a bulge from a returning abscess.  pressing my lower abdomen to see if i was in pain from a recurrence of diverticulitis.  sleepless night staring at my phone on healthline or mayo clinic.   recently, i started having this bubble sensation in the sternum area near my chest, it would come out of nowhere and almost ""pop"" and be gone.  no rapid heartbeat, blood pressure normal, but the more i worried, the more they'd come along, mostly all at night, when my mind has more opportunity to wander.  one night was so bad i did go to the er, they hooked me to an ekg, did a chest xray, blood tests.  nothing really, no heart attack.  was home in bed within a few hours.

my pcp suggested a holter monitor ekg which i wore for a day this week.  no results yet as the doctor has been out, but i'm guessing if it was anything truly pressing i'd have known by now.  i think folks here understand my predicament and i just needed to say it out loud to someone other than my wife.  she herself has had anxiety issues in the past and says it's probably a post traumatic anxiety.

"helpful starter links for dealing with health anxiety **edit: i have found all the modules, a long with the parent link. i have now included all of them for you :)**

i, like many of you, have been dealing with debilitating health anxiety - specifically, concerning me focusing on my stomach, kidneys and waste (literally examining every urine and bowel movement).  i have been to the doctor 3 times already, have done 2x blood tests and a stool test, and everything came back okay, yet i am still unconvinced, a feeling i'm sure many of you can relate to.

&amp;nbsp;

so tonight (since it's a sunday and i can't call my doctor yet again :p), i decided to look for some self help. through a google search i came across these .pdfs that have already brought some comfort to me, in the short few minutes i've been working with them.  apparently, there are 9 modules, but i have only been able to locate modules 1-3, 6, and 8-9 (missing 4, 5, and 7).  i am going to keep searching for the rest of them, in an attempt to maximize the effectiveness, but for now, i'd figure i'd share these with you, friends.  hopefully they help to bring some comfort to you.

but about the party. i knew almost everyone there, i've known them for a long time now and they're closer to me than my family. i helped set up the party so i didn't feel like i wasn't being useful, i took my time this morning in making sure i looked presentable, and of course i showed up early just in case. 

the party lasted about an hour and a half, and i even got to talk with some of the people there!

"questions for new anxiety sufferer... does anybody's anxiety present with just the following symptoms:

chest tightness

tightness in the front of the neck and under the chin

light-headedness/dizziness

feeling faint/like i may pass out

nausea

these are the symptoms i've been feeling. i don't really seem to have an impending sense of fear or doom when these things happen, but i will say they are triggered by talking about my condition, or just general stress, but sometimes they happen for no reason at all. i have just been sitting watching tv, playing a video game, or scrolling through reddit and they've happened.

i've been to the er three times at two different hospitals in the past week with these symptoms (in addition to high blood pressure) and all three times, my blood work and ecg have been normal.

i need to add, a lot of these symptoms got worse when lying down, and got better when sitting up or walking.

in light of that last detail, the er doctors said ""it's just gerd"" and sent me home with orders for a ppi medication and a blood pressure medication.

well, the gerd has improved, and all the symptoms i've listed above have improved as well but haven't gone away.

i'm seeing an anxiety doctor later this week, and out of an abundance of caution, a cardiologist later next month (soonest they could get me in)

*another detail: i received a call from the doctor earlier telling me my cholesterol was high and my potassium was a little high from the lisinopril (bp med) so they started me on a diuretic and a cholesterol medication. as soon as i got off the phone with that news, i instantly started feeling the pressure in my neck and chest... this is what leads me to believe my symptoms are anxiety related.

"spinning out with health anxiety hi all,

new post, struggling big time with health anxiety, to the point that it is becoming hard to cope.

i'm 36 years, old, i have two kids, currently nursing a 1 year old. about 4-6 months ago, i started losing weight. initially i thought nothing of it, i figured it was just being a busy mom!

but fast forward and within that time, i caught just the most random viruses, and badly. i caught a flu that immediately turned to pneumonia. i caught a viral rash from my 4 year old niece. my weight kept dropping.

at this point, i started to become understandably anxious and curious as to what was happening. i had bloodwork during my pneumonia that came back ""normal"" in her eyes. but i noticed today there was elevated platelet count and low lymphocytes. which are commonly linked to cancer of some sort. why did i google it?

i'm just spinning out, because i lost my dad recently to a very rare aggressive cancer. something just doesn't add up. i'm just scared that it is something seriously wrong. i'm getting more bloodwork done to hopefully alleviate my worries now that i am healthy... it could just have been related to the pneumonia, and the weight loss to nursing, anxiety and being a busy mom. but i can't see her until next week, and it is just torturous waiting.  

any tips on how to cope? similar experiences?",Anxiety,245

"terrified of catching the flu after ent visit. i've been a huge germaphobe for as long as i can remember. in the spring and summer it usually doesn't cause me to much distress, but once cold and flu season pick up, it starts to have a greater impact on my mental health and my ability to function. 

earlier today, i had my bi-yearly appointment with my ent to get my ears cleaned out (i produce a ton of wax). i was super anxious going into the appointment as there is a very bad cold going around my area right now, and the flu is widespread. i took hand sanitizer with me and was prepared to grab a mask if the waiting room was busy. 

thankfully, there wasnt a single patient in the waiting room. i was called back quickly,  the nurse took some info, i sanitized my hands, and then my ent entered the room. he shook my hand, and then sanitized his, and got to work cleaning me out. 

once he finished i asked a quick question about how to avoid facial and ear pain on a long flight, and he suggested the vasalva maneuver. he demonstrated it for me, and then asked me to try it. ordinarily, i dont touch my face under any circumstances, but since i had just sanitized my hands and since i was just pinching the outside of my nose (i was careful not to get too close to my nostrils), i figured it would be okay. so i pinched my nose very briefly and went on my way. 

on the drive home i started to think about it a bit more, and realized that after i sanitized my hands, i shook his hand, so my hands probably were not very clean when i pinched my nose shut. and i started to get really worried that in doing so, i probably exposed myself to tons of cold/flu germs that will infect me in the coming days. 

now i'm anxious as can be, trying to find some rational reason why i shouldn't be worried here, so i can calm down a bit. i havent had any luck yet. can anybody help me out here? 

also, just for the record, i'm seeing a therapist twice a week to help with these things. we just started back in october, but unfortunately he's been out of town all of december for the holidays. i've backtracked a good bit in his absence. i'm also more anxious than usual about getting sick because i have a vacation coming up next week and i really dont want to have a cold/flu while traveling.

"dog died on new years, scared of rabies okay so i posted this on the anxiety subreddit and that should of been enough but my anxiety still is being awful so uh-- posting this here too since health anxiety is a big one for be in general anyway...? sorry ;;;

basically, i had an old dog, like 14 years old. he started sleeping a lot more around christmas, and all, and when i cold front blew in that week, he started having a harder time walking around (he'd been wobbly already), and then thursday he collapsed on his front legs and couldn't eat back up. his front legs couldn't move, but back legs were fine, and he ate and drank what we gave him fine. 

during that thursday i absent minded lot scratched the inside of my nose after doing something and he licked, which is what started the paranoia.

my poor dog couldn't move, but his back legs still could--- and his jaw never got paralyzed and he never got the excess salivating deal.

we have him pain meds at a vets advice, which seemed to of gotten his front legs working again, still back legs working too, he just couldn't get up yet. but he was moving more, his head too. he even ate that day. unfortunately, he started bloating, fell into a coma, and died that day, which was new years.

i've brought my paranoia up with the vet, and he did say with everything i told him and showed him that rabies shouldn't even be a concern. another commenter seemed to agree too.

and--- yeah, i know better--- he wasn't even paralyzed in that way, it was the pain in his bones--- the pain meds helped him, in those final moments. and he never had a hanging mouth, he could move it and eat fine, and didn't foam or excessively salivate or anything. but even still, i've been absolutely paranoid every since despite knowing better. despite knowing that wouldn't of been rabies, since if it was his limbs wouldn't of gotten better--- but my mind keeps telling me what if it is, what if it is--- what if it's too late and you'll have it and your mom will have it and you'll die--

ugh. i know i'm going to get a full doctor checkup tomorrow, and take steps to get help with my anxiety, but as it is right now it still feels so awful and constraining. i can't even focus on my usually drawing or other creative ideas because this anxiety has gotten in the way so much. i can't even properly grieve my dogs death because of this. i'm /scared/ despite being told that it shouldn't even be a consideration. i hate it.",Anxiety,460

"recent onset of ha, trying to nip it in the bud hi all.
back in november i had a rather large health scare. i had a real symptom that i was dealing with for 2 years, i thought it was just something simple so i kept putting it off. i never had ha before, and was so laid back i let this issue go on for 2 years.
finally saw a doc about it and immediately was ordered a ct scan. i got afraid it was serious. went in for the scan and had to wait 12 days to get the results back since it was over thanksgiving. i was... not myself these days. pretty much mortified as i was finally coming to terms with my mortality, wishing i went earlier, etc...

thankfully, to so much relief, the scans came back clean. the issue i had was very real, however. docs knocked it up to a really bad cold i had that did some damage on my body. annoying, but manageable. thankfully not the big c or a brain tumor. 

i am healthy.

since then, however, i've been shook. it's been some time now, but since i've had more ha than i ever had before. my family line is healthy, i'm relatively healthy, etc. 

however, i've been over analyzing myself and have thus far 'induced' two issues. the main one being over-noticing my eye floaters and oddities i had my whole life, that i literally never had before. eye things seem to be the big thing right now with me, i don't know. i don't have visual snow, but am afraid if i think about it too much, i might get it. 

i have an eye exam scheduled soon. i was due for a standard one anyway, but i don't know why my mind is in 'something is wrong with your eye' mode when my eyes have been like this my whole life (and i have had many normal exams).

i really want to nip this in the bud, before it gets too bad. 

i think it's still 'young' and i can overcome it and beat it before it consumes my life. i need to. 

i'm looking for self help methods right now. guides, meditations, even books. please do not suggest therapy at this time. it is something i may consider in the future, but i am not in the right place or mindset for it right now (had a traumatic experience with it in the past. i need therapy for my therapy. ha.)

"does this just sound like anxiety/depression? hey! i know you guys arent doctors, and i am waiting for a call back from psychiatrists, but i was wondering if any of you guys have had similar symptoms and could give me some insight.

i feel like the way most people describe there anxiety is a lot different than how mine feels.

&amp;#x200b;

sometimes i just get these episode where everything gets ""scary."" i just feel confused and very on edge and everything makes me jumpy. my life feels almost like a horror movie during these times. usually a small sound (such as my fridge, pc, anything really) will seem to grow louder and seem eerie/spooky. my thoughts go down this loop of ""do i have some sort of serious chronic mental illness, will i feel this way forever, will it get worse?"" and of course i try to shut these thoughts down and sometimes can, but the feelings are still there and very real. sometimes i get very weird (and super brief) thoughts of doing rash things (flipping the fuck out on my grandma for example). it feels like there's an anchor in my stomach and sometimes, but not usually, ill get shaky and have heart palpitations. these episodes last for well over 15 minutes and i never feel normal afterwards so i get annoyed when people label them as simple panic attacks, because they way other people describe there's, i feel as though mine are a lot different. 

&amp;#x200b;

another thing to add, is over the summer i did acid for the first time, and i always read that acid will onset any mental illness you are going to get in the future. so i often fear that i did acid and fucked myself over because of it, but nobody on either side of the family has a history of schizophrenia or anything of the sort.

i have a smear test coming up soon and i don't know how i am going to cope between the test and the results. i know it is going to trigger my health anxiety and i do not know how i will function such as getting up and going to work. 4 years ago i was in such a bad place with my health anxiety i stayed in bed for weeks and was physically sick with worry.

"psychiatrist told me not to google my medication, feeling weird about it starting this off by establishing that i am autistic, and one of my interests is self categorization. this can make me come across as a hypochondriac or doctor shopper, as i know my disorders/illnesses very well. once i started seeking treatment for my bipolar i learned everything there was to learn, joined communities such as this one, and started talking to others with bipolar.

as a result of this, i learned a lot about medication. not even really on purpose, learning about the meds people are on is just an inevitable of being in a group like this.

my psyche prescribed me abilify today, and out of curiosity i asked if that was the med known to sometimes lead to tardive dyskinesia. i'm not against trying abilify, all meds can have horrible side effects, but i wanted to know if that's what i was potentially getting myself into. i love my psyche, she's super nice and receptive, but she sorta laughed and told me to ""stop googling your medication"" which rubbed me the wrong way. it's a drug i'm unfamiliar with, should i not want to be prepared for the potential risks? i've told her before i'm open to trying anything, so it's not like i was telling her i wouldn't take it because i was scared, i was just asking a question so i know what to look out for.

"anxiety level: 1,000,000 - husband's surprise christmas present for christmas my husband bought me a 6 week training program at a local boxing club. i've never done class-like exercising, so i was pretty concerned that my social anxiety would be a problem. i was right.

the training program includes a strict meal plan and weekly weigh-ins. if you lose 20 lbs in 6 weeks then you get all your money back. unfortunately, it's triggered my eating disorder and now i'm restricting like a mofo.

the first class i went to, i had to sit out part of the time because i almost passed out. i've done 3 classes so far and it's incredibly embarrassing when i have to take a break to sit down while everyone else is still up and punching their bags.

i know i shouldn't compare myself to everyone else, because i'm just a beginner and they might not be, but i can't help it.

i think it's sending me into a depressive state. all i want to do is sleep and not think about going to class or eating...

"feeling like i don't do enough i'm not sure if this is due to the disorder or not, if it's imposter syndrome, if it's from old christian mantras of ""put others before yourself"" being baked into my psyche since childhood, or if it's a combination of all three; but i often feel like i don't do enough for other people in my life. whether it's with other family members, close friends, or co-workers, i often get this sense. 

i work from home. and i've done a lot on our current project over the course of this past year. but now that we're sitting near the finish line, almost ready to go-live with not much else to do other than wait for the cutover, i can't help but feel some kind of guilt like i'm not doing enough. even though i helped our team make a ton of progress in the past few months. 

with friends or family it often comes in the form of ""should i be there?"" or ""i know i be there, be present, but i really don't want to"" and then i just feel like a pos terrible friend/sibling/son/etc. for not doing it. for example, a relative of mine had a gender reveal party a few weeks ago. naturally, i didn't go. i'm not particularly close with this family member and haven't been for years. nonetheless i still felt like an asshole for skipping. especially later when i talked to my dad and asked how it went;  i asked ""who was there?"" and he said ""just about everyone. except for you"". i don't think he intended to make me feel guilty, but it kind of did. my mom corrected him later and pointed out a few other family members that didn't make it, but nonetheless i felt like i didn't do enough. even though, again, this relative having the child and i don't really talk or show interest in one another's lives anymore. 

another example is a friend, a close friend, who really does their best to help me get out of the house and do things. they'll invite me to things at bars or restaurants, and 9 times out of 10 i don't go. part of me appreciates the hell out of that, because i need it, and it's nice to be included/wanted. another part of me wishes they'd leave me alone; because i don't think i'm interesting enough or worthy enough to hang out with. then i start feeling a whirlwind of guilt and shame for bailing out of the request. 

wondering if all these feelings of guilt or shame are part of the disorder, or if it's something else. anyone else experience this?",Personality disorder,449

"it's hard when loved ones don't understand avpd my mom basically tells me it's my fault i feel alone because i reject all of her offers to socialize (which, i'm not denying..it is my fault lol). when i tell her i want to make *new* connections with strangers she tells me that makes no sense and why don't i hang with family..

she doesn't get it when i say family scares me more than strangers. with strangers, there's much less at stake. they don't know shit about you, you don't know shit about them, and if something goes wrong you never have to speak to them again. it's one and done. 

she also didn't understand why i wanted to work retail (i don't anymore for different reasons now). she asked me how can i talk to strangers yet i'm too scared to talk to family. she doesn't understand that i just do better in work or education based settings..

you don't have to get into your personal life that much and once the day is over you go home and don't have to talk to them. there's not much expectations because they're your classmates/coworkers. you don't have to let them know too much about you

my mom just doesn't get it and i hate talking to her about anything at all because she gives me over simplistic solutions and lowkey makes me feel bad for having these issues when she's part of the reason why i have it in the first place. as an adult, it's my responsibility to fix this but i know what my threshold is, i'm tired of her acting like she knows me better than i know myself (and she told me she knows me better than i know myself).",Personality disorder,294

if you ve just been through something very stressful or a time of high anxiety be easy on yourself i know instinctually we expect to just bounce back immediately after said stressor is gone but high level of stress take a toll on both your mind and body it ll take some time to heal you might continue to feel stressed not a much a before but still be extra prone to anxiety trigger physically drained tense achey sour stomach nausea etc and before you freak out about how you feel think back to the basic before you jump to something scary did you eat enough today what did you eat did you drink enough water today how much sleep did you get this past week how sound wa that sleep did you have to take a different medication recently what s your posture been like any constant muscle tension have you socialized much recently have you gone outside recently think of these question not judgmentally but objectively sometimes it s hard to take perfect care of yourself it s not something to beat yourself up over say you re feeling really fatigued lately if you ve barely eaten anything and been getting poor sleep then it s not surprising at all that you d be tired that s on top of chronic anxiety which can cause unpleasant physical and mental symptom even when you re doing everything else right just because you feel crappy doesn t mean you have some scary life threatening disease it suck to feel like that but try not worry yourself over thing that at the moment are just fantasy granted if you feel like this all time like me i d recommend seeing a therapist and or psychiatrist maybe even going for a regular doctor visit if you haven t gone in a long time just to check in on thing basically what i m saying is don t scare yourself into a panic over your physical symptom but if you feel like they are interrupting your life it might be a good idea to seek help and there s nothing wrong with seeking help either if someone is having trouble seeing thing clearly they go to an optometrist for help this is the same thing for some reason or another our body brain isn t working how it should for u to lead a healthy life it s not our fault and it s not shameful to need help hope ya ll have a good week,Depression,423

"tl;dr: i feel like i caused my best friends death and my entire life crashed around me, now i do not want it anymore. i guess ill just start from the beginning. ill speed this up though because i do not want to take up too much of your time. in like 6th or 7th grade i made friends online playing overwatch with a dude, like really good friends. i never had a buddy i could talk to casually and safely about literally anything from after school until 4am. we used to have a joke where wed just tell each other do not be a bitch for advice. it was laughable, really it was, because we both knew each other would give real advice anyway. those would end up being my most hated words ever.back in april of this year, i had a decently healthy relationship with a gf i had for about 6 months, and got accepted into college and was graduating high school. my friend and i started facetiming and he started to drive. he told me he should stop and i told him to not be a bitch. we told each other jokes and laughed really hard. he turned to look at me for a brief moment, looked back at the road, and got in an accident. his head went through the windshield and he died instantly. i panicked, and i do not usually do that. i felt enormous guilt, i still do. what had happened i felt was my fault entirely. so much so that i promised that it would never happen again. i left my gf and all of my closest friends for their safety. that was the hardest decision of my life. they all tried to get me to stop but i did not listen. i played minecraft with my now dead friends little brother, he must have been 7-8 years old. i have never heard a kid cry like that. i did not even have the balls to tell him what happened or that i was sorry for it. flash forward to about a few weeks ago, i tried overdosing on pills. obviously that did not work, i guess i am inept? but i visited my grandparents house, started going through some old stuff. i found my grandpas old pistol and held it up. it just seemed like the right thing to do. i could not do that either. i wussed out. i have tried drinking to forget or maybe honor my lost friend(s) but nothing works. i cannot sleep. i guess i am asking for help but honestly maybe i do not deserve it. i am sorry for writing so much, maybe i just needed to get this off my chest. i am sorry my best friend died and its my fault",Depression,470
"don't be like me (little rant) i was a college freshman at the beginning of covid. i was just your stereotypical introverted/ quiet guy who also struggled in social situations. covid gave me the perfect excuse to avoid anything stressful. don't have to go to class, don't have to meet anybody, everyday i just drowned myself in entertainment. eventually i dropped out of class and basically became a shut in.

fast forward to a couple years later. i have no idea how time went by so fast. everyone is all grown up and busy, people keep asking about how i'm doing at school, and everytime i lie to my parents that yeah i'm going to school, i did good on my exams, i'm about to graduate etc. it's so fucking unfair to my parents that i turned out to be such a piece of shit. 

i hate what i've become, just lies and avoidance. when i'm actually motivated to do something, i'm then immediately reminded by the reality that no matter what i do i still wasted all these years of my adulthood, that i'm still betraying my parents' expectations, that nothing i do is going to undo all the damage i did to myself. 

i'm a mess. i have no hobbies i can share with normal people, i have no humor because i don't have any experience in the real world, i can't make my family happy because i don't even like myself and it shows. 

sorry for the rant, sometimes you take a step back and really look at the situation you put yourself in and it's unbearable. why didn't i try harder at school? why didn't i tell my parents the truth? facing all these fears, i chose the easy way. and it is clearly the wrong choice, otherwise i wouldn't be suffering this much now.

"my [31] bf[36] of 1.5 year is generally quite a charismatic and positive person. he jokes around and can be absolutely charming. if you talked to him as a stranger you would never think he may be depressed, but i am starting to get seconds thoughts, and its breaking my heart.he grew up in a rich family with a lot of staff who helped the family with the house, and went to an expensive private school. also he was the youngest sibling in his family, so he enjoyed a careless childhood.then he studied, worked some years very successfully, met me. he had some relationships with women before me, but they were always somewhat traumatic or abusive. now - i think - we have a very caring relationship. he has a very strong charismatic personality, he is manly, talented, very empathetic and smart. we have met about 1.5 years ago. for all this time till now his working hours were cut down due to corona, and he worked only 3 days a week from home, so he had a lot of free time. and besides working he has done all the same things for 1.5 years. he smokes, reads social media, watches series (most of them hes seen before), eats. he has insomnia. he often wakes up tired in the morning. his work is frustrating for him, but he seems to feel insecure to search for another job. recently when i jokingly said something about an old psychological trauma of mine, he answered seriously: and my trauma was having to go to work 5 days a week. and the puzzle got together in my head today. i think that as kind in a rich family he never was taucht the concept of labor of any kind, and work is actually something really unpleasant for him. his current job is especially boring and feels unnecessary. so he never really accepted that he has to go to work, its actually a trauma, and he dreads it all the time. when he learned that he has to work 5 days again, he was glum and grumpy for a whole week. i really wish he would get therapy on the matter. but i am afraid that he would think its a sign of weakness, and that the world just works this way. that everyone has his job that much... but i disagree! i feel that something is dreading and exhausting him all the time! and i think its fear that he has to work, and he will have to do it for many more years. i love him. i do not think hes a lazy person, i believe its an actual problem. please recommend me how i can help him. i think my bf [36] is depressed but hes hiding or not realizing it. its breaking my heart. i need advice.",Depression,476

"a whole slew of problems... normal? i've been dealing with anxiety since september, specifically generalized anxiety disorder (gad). since then i've had a few recurring symptoms that my first doctor had waved off to anxiety, but since then have gotten more common. i will be talking to a new doctor soon since i need to get back on meds after my last attempt ended, so i will be talking to them about this, but wanted others' opinions/experiences too, for comfort especially.

i had a huge fear of contracting rabies since i work with animals. i know this is not logical, since any animal that has ever scratched me (i've never been bit) has not had rabies, and since even though i exhibited some general symptoms that happened to line up with rabies, i've been this way since september. so, i'd be dead by now. 

some of those symptoms are, like i said, pretty general and line up with anxiety-related symptoms. minor muscle twitching, ""foggy"" thinking, being irritable, trouble swallowing/dry mouth (has never impaired eating/drinking), etc. i also have had a totally random symptom from those, which is sharp, short-lived pains in my chest, and now they're along my lower abdomen and uterus. 

my new doctor has seen me once for chest pains when they wouldn't stop one day. she said everything sounded fine as far as my heart and lungs, i wasn't experiencing limited breathing, and the pain wasn't long-lived and was sharp, not like a pressure or anything. she was hoping it was from acid reflux, which i was having issues with, but after a month of medicine for that, i'm still having that.

"its like i am at war with my heart hey people. 27m here. i have had panic attacks 7 years ago. i had severe anxiety for a year, then i used antidepressants, got a girlfriend and stabilized my anxiety for many years. i still had episodes of severe anxiety/stress and depression but it never turned into full blown health anxiety that triggered panic attacks and major anxiety symptoms until recently.

i have been very stressed thees past months and i finally had multiple panic attacks within the span of a month. ended up in the er 2 times. so as a person experienced with it, i thought i can overcome it more easily and systematically this time. took some anxiety episodes like a boss, started ssri(which elevated anxiety so far) and tried to fix things again.

so my last barrier was to exercise as it had been a major weapon for me to overcome my health anxiety. today i tried to go for a run but was breathless and my chest was hurting(due cold i guess? i don't know) pretty bad. i became anxious and dizzy. my dizziness went on for hours and i think i still have it.

i am 27 and i had ecgs done during 2 of my attacks where the doctor told me it is not a heart attack this past month.

but this dizziness thing and basically whenever i measure my blood pressure it turning out quiet high at around 15 - 9/10 whenever i go to a doctor to have it measured is freaking me out.

i feel like my body is getting severely damaged due to my constant high blood pressure and the dizziness obviously screws my functionality. i'll go to a cardiologist regardless. i went to one 6 months ago and he told me all was fine before i was having these attacks.

but is it possible to have dizziness and hbp that often with anxiety? i can often see my blood pumping in the body when this state becomes very strong. i want to get back to exercising/working out to have a normal life but i am scared that its going to be what kills me...",Anxiety,365

anxiety reared its head and i was suddenly worried about exposure to rabies. i did call urgent care to see what they said. they didn't know the answer right away and had to do a bit of research. the verdict that came back was ""porcupines don't carry rabies, so you should be fine.""

adderall is making me sleep 6 hours a night which makes me feel amazing. i used to sleep 6 hours back before i was medicated, and it feels just so fucking good. for some reason, the less i sleep, the better i feel. i haven't felt this fucking energized in a while. i only took 20mg 2 days ago, and 10mg yesterday. 

im making this post because:

1) i was wondering if any of you have a similar situation where less sleep makes you feel better? and if you have any similar medication history and if you can provide any insight into this situation to me? how did these realizations help you and what were your next steps?

2) if i told my doctor that adderall was making me sleep less, would she take it away from me? i only take it to study, but i fucking love sleeping 6 hours. i felt well rested when i woke up today for the first time in like 6 months. im wondering if i can tell her this information or if she would be worried about it triggering mania. she mentioned to me that she wanted to do a ""sleep test"" on me.

"i mean i have cried over you, i have hurt and sometimes, it kind of does, like a pinch, when i remember you are ignoring me after everything we did together. our firsts. but you are young, were both young, maybe i should have saw this coming. i should have known you having a dream of us having a family was not as deeply meaningful as i wanted it to be. you cannot even bother to say hi back anymore and when you do its short responses. shorter and just different than how you used to not that long ago. i do not think i am dumb, i know you are avoiding me. i just wish you would tell me you want some distance or something. is it because i told you i am getting help? do you just want to avoid me until i am better? why did not you do that before i gave you head. when i told you my traumas and how i have been having episodes. but its whatever. i am probably looking too deep into something that was probably surface level to begin with. i do not feel that much over it now. i do not feel much over anything. my cat is sick and after four days of no drinking or eating she finally wants to again, but i still feel nothing. maybe anger towards my mom for how she is abusing her but not much else. i cried but it does not hurt, it just happened. i just wish i had some kind of support through this. i would like to think i deserve some kind of support when i am making my efforts to get better and begin recovery. i mean i just had to lose my first job too on shit terms because of my health. but i am alone. i am always alone. its that from birth until death. always alone. i hope this time i am coming to terms with it. maybe i will not even say anything to my doctor next month. maybe ill keep it the way its been and then i can kill myself. i do not have support for me getting better and i do not feel like i deserve help in the first place. what was i thinking. jesus fuck just numb i guess, i do not know",Suicidal,395

"did xanthan gum make me go manic? confused.... can anyone relate to this? i was on a really strict diet, off dairy, gluten, not eating anything processed, and feeling pretty stable.  i was even sleeping well.

then someone brought me a treat, these gluten free cookies and chocolate soy milk.  i ate the cookies, and as time progressed, started to feel more unstable.  like unpleasantly stimulated, unfocused, bloated, and i was up all night with insomnia and strange sensations going on in my body.  i then read the ingredients on the cookies, and it contained xanthan gum, and tapioca starch, and i decided to be cautious about those ingredients, and didn't have any more cookies. 

i didn't however read the ingredients on the chocolate soy milk, which turned out to also have xanthan gum.  i kept drinking this for three days, and my insomnia became steadily more severe, and i started having to rely on sedatives again to sleep.  my mood was also elevating, and it became harder to focus on anything.  i was feeling insanely promiscuous :s then by day four, my anxiety and panic skyrocketed.  i ended up getting so desperate, feeling hyper social and feeling so needy and vulnerable and afraid that it made me reckless, making dangerous plans, needing to meet up with any man or else i was convinced i'd die.  i needed someone to hold me or else.... almost got myself in some trouble, and was not thinking at all.  thankfully i managed to stay in the house, and not act, mostly because my family came back early and i could no longer have any strange men from the internet over........

anyway, since i stopped drinking that chocolate milk, i still have anxiety but am finally feeling a bit... more settled...... i'm back to being my introverted self again, and not wanting to socialize at all, and am just thankful that nothing really bad happened.  

i'm just confused about why that happened to me.  also, during that whole time, i was horribly bloated.

can anyone relate to anything like this?

i'm confused and feel alone in this.  and this isn't something anyone else really understands.

if you read the comments here, you'll find a lot of people have had puzzling reactions to this ingredient, and insomnia is a common response:

"success or hypomania? regardless things are finally looking up. today my psychiatrist released me! she saved my life several times and i saw her for 5 years but now i'm moving across the country and will need to find someone new. i thought she was going to change my medicine but she said i seemed too stable to make any changes with the move coming up and her not being able to observe me face to face anymore. wow that felt good to not *need* to add another med. she emphasized my progress and that i should find a doctor in my new area within the next three months but that she considered our time together a success because i became more and more stable as time went on. i walked out of that appointment on air. 

feeling great. feeling great. walked right into a tattoo parlor and spontaneously got another piercing. next door was a record store so i spent 100$ on vinyl. i'm hoping i'm just treating myself instead of ramping up to hypomania. 

i finally graduated college in december after a whole year of stability and things are truly looking up for me for the first time since 2011. just wanted to stop in to brag a little bit (sorry) but mostly remind you beautiful humans that stability and success are possible! just keep trucking! i'm so glad i didn't give up and end my life before the good part started. love and light to all of you. thanks for your support along the way i love this community.

"(idk what subreddit to put this in, so i decided to put it in here)why is it that when someone admits that they may have a bad characteristic, people admire it? they are impressed that someone can admit to having a weakness. such as being too sensitive, or too inconsiderate, too myopic, too loud, too shy, etc. in general people are impressed that others can admit a weakness about themselves. people admire that you can admit fault and be able to constructively criticize yourself.now, once you start talking about physical attributes such as being too skinny, or too fat, or not good looking enough its becomes a matter of self esteem. not a matter of constructive self criticism, its now that you are insecure. they tell you that you need to think better of yourself. that your looks do not define you. ""work on your self esteem"" or ""you sound insecure"". why cannot i just peacefully say or admit that i am not good looking? or that i am not in anyway physically attractive? why does that make me insecure acknowledging a fact about myself? i know and i am reminded everyday. i can see how i am treated differently as opposed to conventionally attractive people. i know that i have never been liked romantically by anyone. why cannot people accept that instead of invalidating me and saying i am too negative or that i am just *insecure*?i am not asking for pity or for validation. i just stated a fact that i have observed about myself. if it makes you uncomfortable so be it. but you would be fine if i admitted that i was not outspoken, or a good problem solver right? i would not be insecure, i would just be someone who wants to be better. i am not insecure, i am also not blind. i see myself in the mirror everyday. pretending that i am attractive is not going to change anything. so stop. insecurities",Depression,329

but okay, that said, i am capable of moderation - i can do a glass of wine here or there without totally flying off the handle, and i have done so while taking my depakote with no noticeable differences (and i was on a much higher dose at one point while doing so).  what i haven't tried, since meds, is weed.  

this is not the type of question i feel comfortable asking a doctor since weed is still very, very illegal where i live lol and i am aware redditors can not dispense reliable medical advice (and i am also aware that it is not allowed on this sub).  luckily, i'm not looking for advice - i'm looking for personal experiences.  

i am curious if anyone else has experience mixing depakote and weed?  did it make it more sedating?  did it make you paranoid or jittery?  was everything exactly the same?  is depakote and the occasional, rare high any more dangerous than depakote and the occasional, rare glass of wine or beer?",Bipolar,234

edit to add, i'm in scotland. 

so i've been off work for a year now with severe mh, had 2 s attempts and multiple sh requiring hospitalisation last year. 

i'm on duloxetine 120mg for severe depression, underactive thyroid which i take lebothyroxine for,i have narcolepsy and take 200mg modafinil for that, and i have a blood disorder (cancer?) currently undergoing tests. all these things major symptom is chronic exhaustion but i also have chronic pain (r knee operated on 2020 and currently waiting on l knee op), we're querying fibromyalgia. 

i applied for adp in november last year, and submitted my part 2 in december. 
i submitted as part of my supporting evidence a short patient summary from my gp, my medication list (inc up to date prescription repeats forms), letters from my therapist, letters from the police (involvement after s and severe sh), letters from my mental health team, letters from psych, and a letter from my gp detailing all above and support. 

i've heard nothing from adp so today went to online chat and was told it's been picked up by a case manager (yay) , but that they've requested more si from my gp. 

what?!?!?

what else could they need? and if they've requested that from gp it'll take months before i hear. it took my gp 5 months just to write the support letter they did write. 

so now i'm in an anxiety spiral because if they're gonna deny my claim i wish they would just fucking tell me instead of making me wait 6+months. all the while i can't afford my mortgage and i'm getting deeper and deeper in debt.

"battling with intrusive thoughts tw: (thoughts of) self harm, drug abuse, suicidal thoughts 
(m/22, if you care)


first things first, i really need to vent right now and dont know if anyone is even gonna read that but i just need to get this out of my head.
and sorry, if my english isn't good...

so, i've been battling depression for over a decade, i've mostly gotten better after years of therapy and carefully choosing the people around me so i've been pretty stable for a few years with less and less backlashes.

today marks the first day after about 3 years where i'm getting extremely intense thoughts about self harming, drug abuse and even suicidal thoughts.

i've already been in a pretty bad mood today, overthinking a lot and shit like that and i had to go to social event i didn't really wanna take part in but usually it turns out better than expected. it wasn't like that today. i've felt even worse and useless (despite my friends trying to cheer me up) and realized that i'm not good at anything. i tried to drink those thoughts away with some cocktails (which usually works wonders for me in social events) but that just made it worse.
since i got home i've just been sitting on my bed and staring at the wall, my thoughts going through a downward spiral. i drank some more and feel better and worse at the same time. i've even got to the point that i noticed another issue i haven't even realized before but makes so much sense comparing it to the events in my life. then i thought of numbing my pain with a method i used years ago, forced myself not to because the scars have almost faded out. then i thought about what drugs i could use to distract my mind, even started to research before i stopped myself and decided to rant here.
i'm very aware of my thoughts which makes me instantly feel regretful and even more like a shitty person.

i just want to cry and try to vent through that but that's something i still can't do. love society for teaching boys that they aren't allowed to cry.

anyways, i hope i can force myself to focus on something else now that i've written this shit down. my mind does feel a bit clearer now without taking some extreme steps.

also to everyone reading this: i hope you have a great day tomorrow. and maybe we can all fight our inner demons some day and live a better life. just trying to survive one day at a time.",Depression,442

he agreed to go see a psychiatrist and that's when he got the diagnosis. the doctor prescribed latuda but he complained about extra anxiety, then when the dose went up to 40mg he had a severe reaction of akathisia and panic attack. 

so he stopped taking it and we have an appointment in a few days with the pdoc.

he keeps insisting that we find a drug with no side effects or he goes back to smoking. he thinks the doctor is stupid and isn't worried about how thc might make paranoia worse.

i don't think he knows just how irritable he is almost all the time. i walk on tiptoes worrying that something i say will trigger a 2 hour lecture. looking at other med options it seems seroquel might be better since it helps with anxiety but he looked at the side effect list and balked. 

how do i convince him to keep trying until he finds something that works for him? this seems like a catch 22, he thinks he's smarter than the pdoc but that belief would go away on the right med.

"someone in my life's illness has got much worse. i'd like to know what to expect hi

i was involved with someone's life for a long time. this person was diagnosed with bipolar with serious manic episodes, and treated for about 13 years. the meds were hard to take and she was a bit up and down with them. there were some serious manic episodes that led to dangerous situations. there was little i could do, but i did help keep her on track and try to keep her honest with the meds.

i realise that it must be so awful to have to take dulling medication, and i'm really sympathetic to how these manic events and dropping off lithium built up. i don't want to sound judgemental.

fast forward to now. as of three years ago i no longer have any influence or connection, but have stepped in to help in a really bad episode. it's become clear that she has not really taken her medication seriously for three years. she's been totally freewheeling. the illness i saw in her recently was very different to what i knew from before. i had seen her as driven and worked up, but her moods were cycling from extremes within minutes. it was frightening.

i have read up as much as i can on bipolar and rapid cycling. i get the picture that some people advance towards this after every major episode, and that it tends to be progressive, and not go back to being a single flavour at a time so to speak.

can anyone who has experienced bipolar progressing like this (in yourself or in a loved one) give me a perspective? i'm concerned that she's progressed past some kind of horizon and things are going to be harder for her even on lithium now. just a gut feeling.

i would appreciate hearing relevant experiences. thank you. keep up the fight guys, you're all doing great in this forum.",Bipolar,329

"lowering the doses of my meds, fairly mild triggers for most of my life i have been on huge doses of a lot of medications which made me slow, clumsy, and stupid. i am not like any of those things naturally. 

i have been terrified of changing anything because it almost always leads to suicidal urges and self harm. when my previous psychiatrist changed me from risperdal to geodon  i had a manic episode that lasted several months. i ended up in the hospital, 5150, suicide attempt, lots of cutting. when she put me on serroquel, i had such bad vertigo and extreme sedation that i stumbled into a wall and broke my nose.

i changed to a new psychiatrist about 3 months ago. she wanted to to start reducing my meds. i was willing to try because of the effing side effects and also the fact that the meds don't begin to control my symptoms.

we lowered lamictal waaaay too fast, long story. i was off it for about 2 weeks after taking 400mg a day for many years. i just went nuts when it was all out of my system. i felt suicidal urges that seemed uncontrollable and like i might try, though it was against my will. i cut myself up. my dearest husband has worked from home for the last 3 weeks, keeping me safe. 

i'm now on 100mg of lamictal and i'm hypomanic. i feel awesome. everything has calmed down and this dose feels good. 

i'm more alert and i have some energy. i'm scared about what it will be like to reduce some of my other meds, but i want to do it.

"telling the difference between anxiety and something else? (upper stomach / throat) so i've had these symptoms for more than a month now...getting close to 2 and i know i'm freaking out about them. earlier i felt like i couldn't breathe and something might be wrong with my heart and that got all checked out, got normal blood tests, everything was fine and i finally saw my primary care who said my anxiety seemed really bad. so i felt silly for getting over anxious and i have a therapy appointment and a meds appointment and everything to deal with my anxiety. so that's all set to be dealt with.

that said, everything started in my throat/upper stomach and that hasn't really been checked besides me going ""ahhh"" and doctor's looking down my throat (apparently it looked bad at first, but now looks fine). i'm having discomfort (and some mild pain) in a very specific area right under my breast in the center...front and back...the pain mostly in the back, and discomfort in the front. i burp every time i eat, i never burped before at all and the discomfort is worse when i eat and sometimes relieved when i burp. i have mild nausea. i have mucus in my throat, a white coating on my tongue. and this has been going on for the full 1 month +. 

i'm just not sure...is this just anxiety should i try to ignore it until my therapy appt? is it indigestion or gas or acid reflux or something mild like that (the primary care guy suggested acid reflux, but i'm been trying various remedies for all this type of stuff and nothing seems to help)? or should i ask to be checked? my doctor does have an electronic place where i can ask a question but i just feel silly since i know my anxiety is bad and it might just be anxiety.

i see discomfort in this area can be related to like an ulcer or a hernia so i guess that would be my anxiety but mainly i just hate feeling so uncomfortable and having trouble eating so if there's any possibility it's physical i'd like to get it fixed!

does anyone have any advice or similar experience?

edit: so here's what ended up helping my acute anxiety. 1) i stopped googling. 2) i remembered that while i felt sure i had an ulcer i felt sure a few days ago that i had - anemia - thyroid problems -heart problems and i did get tested for those...and they were all fine, so it's likely this would turn out fine too even though i feel so sure. 3) i distracted myself and tried to do something else.

"i am horrible with words and conveying thoughts so a ""she will"" is the best way i can describe this feeling. i remember may of 2018 when i graduated from college. that was a wonderful experience and a serious milestone in my life. i was so proud of my accomplishment and was absolutely elated the entire week through the graduation ceremony. i felt excited to begin the new chapter of my life: starting a new job, making my own money, having my own true apartment. at that time i felt pretty happy.in january of this year i had been offered a new job (after searching for 18 months). i had received a 40% salary increase, had the opportunity to move to atlanta and move back in with my twin brother. one would argue that this was a serious milestone i achieved after graduating from college. should not i be elated about this opportunity? i have been in the new job for 5 months, the new city for 3 months. as i am typing this post out, i am doing some serious soul searching and asking myself, ""how do i truly feel about this incredible milestone?"" that is just it, i do not feel anything. all i truly feel towards this is ""it is a milestone, and it happened."" its like there is this she will around me that refuses any emotion from entering. i would hate to use the word ""dull"" but that is really what it feels like. the outward emotion that this entire milestone feels, just ""dull"". and yet in reality ""dull"" is not at all how i should be describing this insane achievement. honestly, its hard to explain.side note: i have not been diagnosed with depression but today at work my boss noticed i was making more mistakes than usual so he asked me ""is everything going ok in your world? atlanta still treating you ok? just wanted to check in on you because its not like you to make mistakes. let me know if you need anything."" him questioning this made me think about the status of my mental state over the past few days and ""a she will"" is how i would describe it. and honestly i have felt this way for the past year almost, even at my old job. i have no one to talk to deeply about these feelings so i wanted to share here. does depression embody a ""she will"" around yourself?",Depression,411

"manic psychotic crisis for first time hi, i'm a 21 year old, recently i was diagnosed with bd type 1, due to a manic psychotic crisis, the truth is that i lost my common sense, i had delusions i behaved in a way that now embarrasses me a lot.

the crisis was in the university, it lasted about 1 week being the last days a strong psychosis, because of this i lost several relationships, people who think i'm crazy or i can be dangerous.

i was hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital, and there i was able to stabilize myself after a lot of medication, why talk about side effects and how bad they feel.

i broke my gf and the truth all this takes me very sudden, i have never had depression or any similar episode, in fact i practice a lot of sport and i lead a normal ""life"".

now i feel very lonely and misunderstood, i hope that this bad moment ends, i miss my life before the crisis.

do you have any experience with psychosis?, how do you deal with bipolar disorder?.

i would like to know about your experiences with this disorder and how to face it

thanks you",Bipolar,203

(she was abused by a narcissist in her last relationship so were taking things slow as you can see.) so far we have been great, our feelings were mutual, we talked all the time on the phone, we laughed, it was a good time. but the past few weeks, she is expressed that she is been mentally exhausted, and she feels overwhelmed with everything. i noticed a change in our communication. she barely calls anymore, our texting is dry, and she leaves me on read for hours sometimes. i have asked her about this, and she is assured me that is has nothing to do with me, and that she still likes me very much, but she just feels overwhelmed and tired. she suggested that she might have depression yesterday, but she is not sure because she is never had it or dealt with it. i deal with anxiety which causes me to overthink things a lot. so this situation has been taking its toll on both of us. i hate making this about me, because if she is dealing with depression, i want her to focus on herself and her mental health so she can get better. but when i am talking to her, its draining. because i am trying to be my happy funny self, trying to make her laugh and feel somewhat better, but all i get is crumbs back. and that makes my anxiety go into overdrive with thoughts like she does not like me or she is lost interest and even though she is expressed that that is not the case, due to my anxiety, i cannot help but to think like that and i hate that i do because that is the last thing she needs if she is really going through depression. i want to help her through this and i want to stop feeling this way, but i do not know what to do. i have suggested therapy, but she said its too expensive and she wants to hold off on it for now. i do not know what to do.tldr: girl i am talking to thinks she is depressed and our communication has drastically changed due to that. what can i do to help her and how can i stop feeling like she does not like me because of it? the girl i have been talking to thinks she has depression and i am not sure what i can do.",Depression,419

the downside is that my sleep schedule is now shit and that my swings are back to what they used to be (which isn't all that bad since my depressive swings have always been mild/moderate - it's the hypomania thats the slightly problematic one but i'm aware of when it's setting in).

"reasonable accommodation frustration. to start off with i have a few different mental health disabilities. i am fortune that i am employed full time! i am also ""out"" about having a severe and persistent mental illness at work.

however being in my office causes me some issues in being easily distracted by things going on around me. my disability causes some executive function deficits, along with hyper arosal (awareness... not the sexy kind) 

this summer my 5 year old was diagnosed with two chronic, incurable autoimmune diseases. this of course has made mental health stuff worse. i was lucky to be in a dbt program when it happened or i'd be in a horrible spiral right now. i knew it would effect my performance and i asked my direct supervisor, and manager about working from home 8 to 16 hours a week as an accommodation. at previous jobs this has been heart for keeping me up to date in notes. i was told that as an orginzation we do not have a policy for this.


i said fuck it, and worked from home anyways (making sure i didn't go over my hours) and got caught up. woo! 

over the fall we had a lot of staffing changes and i wound up with double the work load for 3 months. i have stopped working from home becuse i was worried in would get caught and get sacked. my performance has suffered and my new supervisor has noticed.

i again went to my supervisor and director and was told the same thing about their being no policy allowing us to work from home. so i went to hr, with documentation from my care provider. hr just now got back to me, after a month. again they implied they where (but didn't out right) denying the request. 

i've been in contact with an ada specialist in my state, along with askjan about this and it's super frustrating. 

the best/worst and most ironic part of all of this? our orginzation serves people with disabilities. this is what we do for them and teach them what to do. how to obtain and maintain emoloyment. my caseload is only people, like me, who have a serious or sevre and persistent mental illness. ain't that some shit? i love the people i serve, and what i do and this is really leaving a sour taste in my mouth about the orgization.

"rabies anxiety - long term incubation i'm not sure how many of you are familiar with rabies as the subject of your health anxiety, but one of the worrisome things about it is that there have been documented cases where the incubation period after exposure to the virus has been years and years, as high as 25 years in one case (although the evidence for it is not definite). a few other examples of long incubation periods include 4 - 6 years, and around 15.  

my fear here is that despite not having rabies yet, i am incubating this terrifying virus and will ultimately die from encephalitis and insanity, which is the outcome of all rabies diagnoses. 

11 years and 8 months ago i handled two baby raccoons over a period of days my aunt found in her yard after her dog killed the mother. we kept them for probably 3 days, and i would imagine my aunt had them for 2 or 3 days as well, before we gave them to a local animal hospital which gave them to a local wildlife rehabilitation center before release. after dropping them off with the clinic we never heard anything else from them. my father confirmed with me yesterday that he left his contact information. i called them yesterday and they don't have documentation about it that far back, but the woman on the phone was not exactly reassuring because apparently a local, unlicensed person was doing the rehabilitation back then. still, it's someone who would have had the animals in their care for a period of time that would have seen anything to indicate rabies.

i don't recall the animals behaving strangely, but that doesn't say much. i also don't recall being scratched to show blood (maybe some white-marking from their little claws, but no deep contact) and if they did get saliva on me, i don't imagine it was on an open wound. my aunt, father, two neighborhood friends have not gotten rabies. we never heard anything back from the animal hospital. the only report of raccoon rabies is from 2003, before this happened in 2006. in that county in 2006 there was only one documented case of raccoon rabies in the wild (not humans). for the length of time we had the animals, we would have seen some sort of odd behavior. 

and it's been almost 12 years. what are the chances i'm a case study for long term rabies incubation?

"i'm in crisis because how avpd can potentially influence my desicion for a new major i left college, because i wasn't passionate about what i studied and because how much stress i felt of not being socially competent to fulfill a social focused related major.

and i'm here again i don't have much time too choose a major and to go back to college, my parents have told me this is my last opportunity and limit time, but i'm not sure if they would actually follow this through. i don't think they would but i could be wrong. 

all my interests and passions are related to social things, social justice, oppressed populations, people's potential. i have a big desire to help people and i'm interested in social causes and. on my very top are things like social work, sociology, and law

but i'm very afraid of the challenging aspects of my personality and how contrary are to the abilities i need to have for these fields. i don't want to be an incompetent professional because of my characteristics and disorder. i'm extremely afraid of having to leave college again, or not being able to succeed.

and i know that there are different ways to work in these fields. not necesarilly having the most direct contact with people. but i want to have direct contact too. i had an experience in my previous major where i interviewed a person in treatment process after they finished their sentence. and i felt so passionate while doing it and i liked so much interviewing him, analyzing their protective and risk factors, to later make a treatment plan (closest experience to social work)

i also worry that if i go to therapy and solve these issues, maybe i will end up realizing that i can't stand naturally (and in a healthy way) working for long periods of time with people

"hey, so as the title says, i feel like i am in some way broken. therapy is not really changing that, even though i have been going through it for multiple years. below, i will list some of the reasons i think i am broken. \- therapy has stopped making any significant change to my state after a certain point \- i lose interest in any hobbies or potential interests very quickly \- i have enormous problems with laziness; i fail to do basic things, such as cleaning my room, buying myself clothes, making myself food etc. \- for that reason, i lack any sort of skill or knowledge that would be useful to my future life. i struggle with education. \- i find my world view to be constantly proven wrong, and i lack the energy to do much research \- i have trouble formulating my own opinions - i just parrot other people \- social interactions are hard for me, i am very awkward in person. i fail to notice any subtle social cues and undertones. \- building skills is difficult for me - i spend the vast majority of my time gaming, yet i am bad at any game i play and i fail to improve significantly over time \- i seem to be very unintelligent. i often find myself having trouble with solving simple life issues. i also cannot focus very well \- i am doing terribly in terms of driving, despite something around 40 hours behind the wheel \- i sleep a lot to avoid thinking or feeling bad. i am generally sleepy more than the average person \- i rely on my parents to do pretty much everything related to chores and general life stuff for me (i am 18). there are more things, but off the top of my head, that is what i have got. does anybody feel this way? am i really inherently broken and unable to succeed? what do you think about all this? have a great day! i feel like my life is fucked, and i am broken beyond repair.

"i(18m) feel lost, i have never really been sad or depressed but this last year has taken it is toll on me. after i graduated highschool (in the netherlands) i dropped out of school and decided to take a gap year to work and figure out what the fuck to do with my life, it started out fine but these last months my mental health has been declining rapidly. all of a sudden i feel like i am a loser piece of shit that cannot get his shit together. i feel like i am losing the real me and if i look back on fond memories from a year ago it feels like they are not mine. when i am with friends or with my girlfriend i am mostly happy but the moment i am alone my mind starts racing with negative thoughts. the future scares me because i feel like i am supposed to make it in life but i cannot put myself to work on this goal. i have also developed this strong belief that i will die at 28 years old, i do not fear death but this feeling, along with high expectations of myself puts alot of pressure on me. all these feelings have caused trouble in my relationship and we have almost broken up a couple of times because i cannot bring myself to care for the relationship because i am struggling myself. she is is very supportive but some thing you just have to deal with on your own. i guess i am just realy struggling with finding my way in life and i feel like the real me has been lost to all the stress and anxiety, even while i am typing this it feels like my hands are not mine? also when i look in the mirror my brain does not really recognize it as being me. days fly by and i do not remember alot of them because it feels like i am watching it all unfold from a distance.sorry for this long, all over the place post but i needed to get this off my chest i feel lost",Depression,359

"brief mourning period for 4 months of stability well, it happened again. hubris is indeed my downfall.

i tried taking vyvanse again, at a lower dose than the previous dose that made me manic. and i was ok for about a week before the symptoms started showing up. namely, lying (about anything) and some risky behaviors. luckily, not drinking and drugs, but i did take a hit off of a vape pen, which i know is super bad for my brain (no matter how much analog weed i can smoke.) i decided on saturday to stop taking it.

and sunday i blew up.

we were having a disagreement about how to best spend our day on sunday. i wanted to stay very busy, and he wanted to take his time. which is no big deal at all and shouldn't have been what set me off. but it did, and i was in the history of pain.

my history of pain is a mindset i get into when manic brain meets remotely challenging parts of my relationship. suddenly, i am the victim of circumstance and have been forever and will be forever: he doesn't love me, he's shown how he doesn't love me in every action, and on top of that, i don't deserve love for how terrible i am and the terrible things i've done.

and then i'm hitting myself in the head over and over and over, and bashing my skull into anything i can get my hands on.

and then it subsides, and i'm crying, and he wants to get away from me, and i don't understand.

and then it's quiet, and he's mad and i'm still crying, and it seems like i'll never stop and we'll never be happy again.

and then it's quiet, and he's quiet and i'm quiet.

and then we're in the car and talking about the news, and all i want is to be held, but that's asking too much too soon.

i should've trusted my body sooner- there were warning signs that the vyvanse was going to push me over the edge, and i went willingly. and why? because vyvanse would help me achieve my goals, surely, but at the cost of myself and him.

everything has a cost, and this cost was too high. sure, he and i are ok now, but there's the threat of so many next times, and eventually, he'll walk.",Bipolar,403

anyways, i wouldn't say no to them when they asked something of me. nothing too crazy, simple things like small chores that theirs children refuse to do, lend them money when they need, or drive 4+ hours for an event. there are more things. but i do stuff like this for my actual family too and it's making me feel drained mentally and physically which leeds to my depression. i don't have a lot of time to myself and i struggled with nearly becoming an alcoholic. i sacrifice myself like this because i want to see everyone smile and be comfortable especially the children in both families. i don't want them to have a hard life moving around or being around drugs and alcohol. lately my gf has been telling me not to worry about everyone so much and take time to myself. i considered it but i'm worried something will happen if i'm not around to help.

a bit later i started having these headaches, and my vision suddenly got worse (at least i got the impression). now i don't know if this is purely because i started focusing on it, or that it actually is something bad. anyway, i decided to go back to the doctor since i work in it, and dealing with the vision thing and headaches was getting pretty hard.

&amp;#x200b;

he checked me, asked lots of different things but he didn't seem quite sure about what it was. he sent me to an eye doctor, got my eyes checked there, and it turned out i need resting glasses for screen work etc. (my eyes have been bad my entire life, had glasses since i was 3). i've also been having this visual snow, again i think i've had this for a long time, but it's like my mind suddenly seems to notice and freak out about it, same with things like my tinnitus which i've also had for years.

&amp;#x200b;

i'm still just scared i may have a brain tumor, because of the bad vision and headaches. but, if i had a brain tumor, they would have seen it in the blood test from a few weeks back, right? or no? the doctor or eye doctor would have rang the alarm bell if something was seriously wrong, right?

"been lurking over a year on this sub and wanted to share some good news. so i have bipolar 1 with psychotic features as per my diagnoses and i wanted to share some good news with this wonderful community. i will preface this by saying that after i got out of the hospital over a year ago (pretty long and arduous stay around 4 months) i was lost and i had no optimism about my future once i got my phone back i started googling med related things and this subreddit would always come up. i started to realize slowly that there are a large number of people with bipolar living productive and stable lives and that exhibit linear thinking. i thought i was relegated to being acutely ill for the rest of my life and that. i would have at least two major manic episodes a year that would always get me hospitalized. i will spare some of the details about these episodes because they are honestly a bit embarrassing and i imagine they could be triggering (drug usage). anyways it has been over a year since my last manic episode and i haven't even experienced hypo-mania in the interim. over the last year i went from living in group homes and care facilities to finally going back to college and getting a's and went back to work. i have been living in my own apartment for 5 months and have never had a period of stability this long. i think what actually worked for me was staying on medication for more than 6 months and working with a treatment team. i am actually really happy with my psychiatrist from stanford and actually appreciate his style. he doesn't just shove pills in my face and actually takes over an hour to ask about how im doing and then during the last 5 minutes we talk about meds. he was even willing to take me off of my monthly injection and switch me to a lower dose oral dosage which seemed shocked me as the shot was the one thing that i would consistently take due to non-compliance. this made me realize that he trusted me and after that i started trusting him. my relationships are really solid now too and i have actually kept a friend instead of burning all my bridges like before. i actually got a job volunteering at one of the residential facilities i was a client at and this really helps to give me a feeling of fulfillment. i also started making music again which really helps as well. lastly i think that staying sober (with the exception of the occasional beer with family) has been a huge factor in my stability.

"i keep losing my ability to sneeze ok, this is a very bizarre one, but i've been suffering from this issue on and off for over two years, and it's having a big impact on my life.  it'd be great if someone is able to shed some light on this.  i keep losing the ability to sneeze.  basically, i'll get to the ""ahh"", but the ""choo"" won't happen.  i'm not 100% sure, but i think it all started when i had some kind of allergic reaction to something in 2016, and i found myself unable to sneeze for at least three weeks.  during that time, i had quite bad headaches and head pressure.  when i finally sneezed, the pain instantly disappeared.

&amp;#x200b;

since then, the problem keeps coming back, along with the head pain/pressure i mentioned earlier.  i think the longest i've gone without sneezing naturally is three months.  strangely, i can force myself to sneeze by tickling the inside of my nostrils with a pointy tissue, but that doesn't seem to relieve the head pain.  however, i can occasionally sneeze if i think about something erotic and fortunately that does relieve the head pain!

&amp;#x200b;

i've researched this problem countless times and i read somewhere that inability to sneeze could be the sign of a brain tumour, which seems very unlikely because i would also have more serious symptoms, such as an inability to yawn or swallow, which i can do perfectly fine.  also, the fact that i'm able to force myself to sneeze surely means there's nothing seriously wrong?

&amp;#x200b;

i also read that it could instead be a psychological problem, and i honestly think that could be right - sometimes, when i feel a sneeze coming on, it'll come out fine when i'm having a conversation with somebody, so it could be that it helps to be distracted from the sneeze instead of worrying about it.  i would also like to mention that looking at the light in my bedroom sometimes makes the sneeze come out at the last second, despite the fact that i don't think i have the photic sneeze reflex (i.e. ability to sneeze without fail by looking at a bright light).

&amp;#x200b;

"i'm ruining my sex life, please help okay, i think this might be a bit long as i'm trying to include all the information, so here we go.

i (f25) was diagnosed in mid 2021, but never categorized in 1 or 2. i was doing therapy (combo biofeedback with the intent to get to emdr) for a few months and taking 200mg lamotrigine and 10mg lexapro, but i haven't been to therapy in months because of distance and cost, and i've been off my meds for months because the lamoteigine (i think) was causing me sleep problems. 

i work 9 hr days and 6 days a week most weeks while also helping my husband (35m) with his online business (usually don't get home most nights until 9:30). here's where my problems start.

my husband wants sex a lot. when we first got together, we had sex every day for like a year. then it started to slow some but was never really an issue. now we have sex maybe once a week and it's putting a strain on our marriage. he feels like i don't love him or want him or want to be around him anymore. none of those are true and in my mind i have valid reasons for not wanting to have sex when he initiates. i have the kyleena iud so i get some pretty painful cramps sometimes, or i'm tired, or it's late when we get home and i have to be at work a 6 am. recently an additional pronlem is that i've become self-conscious about how i look again. he says i don't initiate enough or respond when he tries to get me in the mood. i tried to explain to him my reasons but he said i'm making it sound like a chore, and sometimes it does feel that way until i'm actually in the act and enjoying  it. it feels like too much work or too much sleep loss in exchange for little. i've gotten to the point where if we do have sex, i prefer quickies. he also says that when i initiate when he's tried, he doesn't turn me down unless he's exhausted.

things are very strained. i feel like i'm sleeping in bed with a stranger, like an old fashioned we've never loved together or had sex before marriage type of relationship. i hate it and i hate that i can't pinpoint a cause or how to fix it. 

is it mania? depression? stress? iud? exhaustion? something i'm missing completely?

"is it shown that being exposed to extreme stress levels frequently, builds higher stress tolerance levels? i hope i'm not on the wrong subreddit for this question.

kind of talking about like the quote, 'what doesn't kill you makes you stronger' or something like that.

i'm not sure, but i feel like i don't cope with stress too well. i can manage to study for long hours without tears or anything, but that is in the past. i feel like these days i'm feeling the pressure. 

i have a feeling that if i fail a question or something like that i just start to contemplate my life even after the exam. even like i would get on the verge of tears if i didn't know something. like if i fail the exam, i don't have good grades, then i don't go to a good university, then i don't get a job or either i get a job with little pay, people make fun of me, etc.

honestly makes me feel anxious, but even if i have coping techniques sometimes i still really wish i could just put myself into extremely stressful environments. but not like life-threatening events, i just want to put myself under immense, crippling stress when i do everyday basic things (like practicing an exam paper, or cleaning within a time limit). 

sometimes i feel that its necessary for me to just stress myself out 24/7, then after that i'll develop a good stress tolerance or something like that. i just really wished i were one of those people who are extremely good at managing stress, and never shed a tear in a very long time (and i mean, years).

to be honest, i know its sounds like i'm really self-sabotaging, but no matter how much i really want to pressure myself to the extremes, i have a feeling it probably isn't right for me. but then again, there's people around me (especially on the internet) who study for hours, or work for many hours, and probably do well under pressure.

just hope someone would answer this question for me.",Stress,352

unfortunately, not to make anyone feel bad about it, as i know this condition is very hard to live with, but i have been trying to look for some success stories from people here, or maybe just some nuggets of hope from people that have managed to peacefully live this life.

so my question for you, especially maybe for the older people here with the condition,or the ones that have managed to get married or with any other kind of ""success"", no matter how small, what is your outlook on life? what advice do you have regarding managing this condition?

although i've also had a rough couple of days, i'd like to believe that not all is bleak and that getting access to good stories from people similar to you can certainly help.

"can abilify induce hypomania? tldr: is it the latuda or the abilify making me temporarily hypomanic at night?

long version: 
i've been on latuda for 3 years, with a 6 week break at the end of a pregnancy (to avoid neonatal withdrawal). latuda made me feel like shit, but i took it because it's the ""safest"" during pregnancy, according to 2 psychiatrists i talked to. it made me anxious, nauseous, and kind of caused a sundowning effect where i got depressed at night (i called it the ""night dreads"").

when i stopped taking it at the end of my pregnancy, i felt so much better, but i know i can't stay off medication. i started taking it again, but the side effects were so nasty that i couldn't deal with them with a newborn. 

my psychiatrist put me on abilify, but i have to cross titrate. i can't just stop the latuda. i'm down to 15 mg of latuda a day, and i'm taking 2.5 mg of abilify. 

i feel muuuuuch better during the day... more like my old self. however, my night dreads have gotten a lot more agitated and started feeling like a mild mixed state. so now i'm wondering which to blame - latuda, or abilify? the nausea accompanying it sure feels like latuda. 

i've been down to 15 mg of latuda for about a week. i'm debating dropping it completely tomorrow and taking the full 5 mg of abilify. i'm worried about mania... i have a 5 week old to think about. can i get some opinions? i'm loathe to give up the abilify, since i feel so much better during the day now. i have a psychiatrist appointment soon, but in the meantime, i'd like to hear what you guys think.",Bipolar,296

so my country is going to have an election in the fall. politics used to stress me out much more in the past; i've since then cut a lot of the sites that were stressing me out and most days, i feel pretty good and don't really worry about it that much. my country has been ruled by religious extremists who are incredibly bigoted for eight years now- i'm so tired of their constant discriminatory comments, blatant disregard for any sort of decency and integrity and they overall just make me so tired and anxious and sad. they've started to rule when i was a teen, and i'm a young adult and they're still at the helm. it seems like they will win this year again, and another, even more extreme religious conservatist party has a chance at becoming the third biggest power.

i fell into a mental hole and i can't get out of it. i know that the elections will be in the fall and it's early spring, but i just feel so depressed and powerless. i feel like i have nothing to look forward to and that it will always just be horrible. i know that it's my brain making a bigger deal out of it than it should, but i'm just so tired of it all- can at least one thing go how i want politically?

"brain tumor worry hey everyone! i'm so glad i just found this sub because i've been struggling with health anxiety for almost my entire life, although it has gotten worse over the past two years. usually i worry about stomach viruses and things related to throwing up, as that is my worst fear, but i've also worried about appendicitis, a stroke, epilepsy, leg cancer, and right now, a brain tumor. my health anxiety has had a profound effect on my life, especially in my transition to college, and it often limits me from eating, going out with friends, and even leaving my room.

i get migraines often, but my most recent headache is a little different. yesterday, i had this weird pressure feeling on the top of my head, and eventually got one of my normal migraines. it went away this afternoon when i took two advil, but the pressure feeling is still there. i don't know how to describe it, it's not really a pain but it just feels weird and a brain tumor was my first thought. i haven't had any other typical brain tumor symptoms, but i have been getting nosebleeds recently, which i've heard can be related to seizures.

people have told me not to be ridiculous because brain tumors are so rare. i know brain tumors are uncommon, but i've known three people that have had brain cancer, one of whom passed away about a year and a half ago (i didn't know her very well but it was still incredibly sad.) i just really hope i don't have one. do my symptoms sound like typical brain tumor symptoms?

"x posted - manic safety plan with so so. i'm a ""constant suicidal thoughts"" person. they're always there but i'm always too exhausted to do anything, and love the people in my life way too much. except for when i'm manic. manic lows or highs give me so much energy and that tends to worry myself and my boyfriend. the only time i really consider hurting myself is when i am manic. often needing my boyfriend to stop me.

i'm going to europe in june and want to work with my boyfriend to create a safety plan for when i'm feeling like this. one of those ""when i'm feeling like this, i'll do this. if that doesn't work i'll do this."" this isn't just for suicidal ideations, but also other side effects to the mania.

a big part of the reason i want to do this with my boyfriend is that he is far more concerned than i am that i'll do something i would regret doing or hurt myself. biggest two concerns are me cheating on him or me hurting myself. mostly this is to put his mind at ease when i'm away. he worries about me so much when i am here, never mind my two months away from him.

but when i was admiring myself in the mirror, i lifted up my hoodie (no i don't wear a shirt underneath my hoodies, the temperature much too hot for that as i can barely wear this hoodie) and i saw that my waist was super skinny. of course, i don't eat much, and i still function fine, so i guess that's okay.

"hey, so i have been having a really rough couple of months, and i think i have messed up my life really badly. i had a lot of really good friends at my college and we were all super tight not. i was dating my girlfriend for about 9 months and over the last couple of months i really messed everything up. i have been continuously pushing her away in all types of ways such as: having little to no sex drive because i have had no ability to even think about that, i have been isolating myself and not communicating what i have been going through well, and i just have not wanted to go on dates. none of this is why she said she wanted to break up though, she wanted to break up because i have not been able to make myself talk to her or communicate while we are back from school. she said i have a lot i need to work on and that she does too.anyway i agree with her and i know i should not be in a relationship right now but i love her so much and want to be with her so bad, so this is not a post where i want you guys to say we should not be together right now because i know this. i think we will eventually get back together if she can see i grew up. i do not want to work on myself for her to take me back but that would be a positive.i guess me making this post is to ask how have you guys been able to work on yourself and what are some methods i can use to improve my mental stability, and also how have you been able to refind yourself when you have no clue who you are anymore?

i need some advice my boyfriend has bipolar 2. lately i've been noticing that his episodes of depression have been getting progressively worse. he's been missing work and sleeping most of the day away lately. i tried to encourage him to go to work this morning. i even told him to take it one step at a time and i would be there encouraging him throughout. he immediately said no. i tried telling him the same thing but with a different approach and he still said no. he started to get aggravated with me so i backed off. i've noticed that he's been getting slightly aggravated with me lately when i try to be encouraging so i'll back off and let him do his own thing once i detect it. the only reason why i try to encourage him so much is because i'm so used to doing it whenever i'm dealing with my own depression. i love him so much but i don't know how to fully get through to him without seeming to aggravated him. can someone please give me some advice on what to do. thank you in advance,Bipolar,192

"narcissistic mom uses family pet as a weapon i don't live with my her anymore so she has less power but she likes to use my bond with the family dog as a weapon. my vulnerable narcisstic brother (over 30yo) ''pretends'' not to like the dog, he doesn't actually hurt the dog but he pretends not to like it and the dog can sense it and feels confused. he moves between this and making a joke about it in front of others to cover himself that it is just purely an act. for example, i know he will have some pictures taken with the dog showing that he likes the dog so if anything were to happen he would play victim. (yet he will keep them hidden)

my nmon knows my brother does this out of insecurity towards me and she plays to it, when i speak to her on the phone she will bring my, brother, into the conversation even when i was not talking about him she pretends to mishear that id asked him a question just so he can say something like''' im just busy punching the dog' then my nmom gleefully says back to me he says he's says he is punching the dog,  and she does this to make sure i say something back so they get the reaction their looking for even though she knows i can hear perfectly well what he said. i dont take the bait but says something to move the conversation along like'' sounds pretty lame''.

they do this routine all the time in different ways and my nbrother has even started a new one where he jokes about getting ready for his fight with me and my nmon plays to this aswell, encouraging the imaginary conflict and trying to bait me into saying something back that escalates the situation. of course again if anything were too happen i would be blamed regardless of the outcome cause it's all just a joke after all. making vague threats of violence and beng low-key mean to the dog.

my nmon has done this in the past with her ex bf she would vaguely threaten me with him and she would encourage them to ''step up'' and  argue with me when they didn't really want too. that led to a fight one time with her bf confronted my youngest brother and cornered him in the bathroom he came out crying and said he got punched which led me to react and a fight. (my bro lied, he was just scared). i ended up getting arrested and blamed for the whole situation, the bf holds deep grudge against me because the trauma so i have to avoid certain family gatherings where he is there. even though my nmom orchestrates the whole thing.

in early december i found out that i have an enlarged spleen after many trips to the er and being sent home because i was having ""a panic attack"" (which i have never had before) finally, after probably over 10 visits i got a doctor who believed me and got me appointments within days... at the time i thought it was my heart, i had a stress test done, and a echocardiogram, they said my heart was in really good condition.

we also discovered i had a high d-dimer and was sent for a ct scan for a pulmonary embolism, which was clear too. my d-dimer has come down since to around 511, much better but not super.

i then got a ultrasound of my gut because they thought maybe it was my galbladder, which was fine, they did however find out that my spleen was enlarged, it was something like 13.5 cm, so not super enlarged, it is still enlarged and it effects my day-to-day life. for example i cannot lie down on that side or cannot eat too much or it gets aggravated.

i have been tested for mono, it was clear, i have just recently (2 days ago) gotten my mirena removed (i need to illiminate all possibilities no matter how small) and he has put me on a high dose of 2 different antibiotics. there is nothing left that i can think of that could enlarge my spleen besides cancer or some sort of virus that has not been found.

other symtoms i am having, currently i have a cough, but i am getting a cold now. however i have had a dry couch since november. i can feel my nodes in my neck and they are really uncomfortable if touched or i turn my head in a funny way. inside my left ear hurts occassionally, as well as my left side of my jaw, sort of where the ear pain meets my jaw. the nodes in my armpits occassionally hurt too. and sometimes my hands have a sort of aching pain as if i used them for something hard and the muscles were healing.

the doctor keeps telling me to relax and enjoy my upcoming trip and enjoy life but wth! everything i have read online says ""an enlarged spleen is not normal"" i don't know where to go from here, i need help, advice... something. i am canadian, if that makes a difference. thank you if you have gotten this far....",Anxiety,429

we divorce, i lose everything, as most men do. i lose my wife, i lose my children (that i raised from infancy, but aren't biologically mine, so i have absolutely no rights in the state i live in and i have never seen them since the day she left). 

i get married, i tell my now wife up-front about everything. she loves me anyway. i can't shake the feeling of what i have done to myself. to take it steps further, i work in child welfare. everyday, i see people who have children and they piss it away. i would give anything for that opportunity. i paid thousands for a reversal and it wasn't successful. i've never been a suicidal man and i've never felt any panic type emotions until all of this hit me in the face.

everything i have done to myself. i know life isn't over, but i now have to face the reality that i could quite literally die alone... and i am 27. i've tried medicine, i've tried exercise, i've tried counseling, for months. nothing shakes this feeling of emptiness. i feel like i was set up and robbed, but what was taken was worth much more than money. i don't know who to call, i don't know where to turn.. i'm not even sure if this is the right place to be but.. i know my wife loves me. i just don't love myself anymore. i feel like the stupidest and most naive man to have ever lived. i trusted my wife. 

most 27 year olds, you know, they do stupid things. i've thought about suicide but not because i don't want to be alive. my parents just think i was stupid for ever making that decision. all i can respond with is, ""yeah, i was pretty stupid."" and that's it.

"i was 17 when i shared an intimate picture of my then gf, who was 18, with a stranger online about a year ago. i regretted it immediately and deleted it. it also did not have her face so it at least it will not ruin her life. i ended up confessing a while later out of fear, the guilt came later. her, being the angel she was, was willing to stay and work it out, but eventually she left because she could not move on. why did i do it? because i got a fucking kick out of it for one moment. i was exposed to fucked up shit from a young age and had a lot of creeps who ""talked"" to me. i knew i was fucked up, but never thought it would affect my relationship with this perfect girl. i was a loner for most of high school and pretty much everyone thought i was a loser and i had a crush on this girl. i somehow got to be with her like it was a movie. turned out i was the villain.last time i posted this, i got a sympathetic response probably because i made myself seem better than i am, so i decided to go with a more objective approach to what happened this time. some days i feel better knowing she has moved on and people make mistakes, but days like today, i deserve to die. i want her to put a gun to my head and shoot me because i emotionally scarred her and we loved each other so much. she trusted me. i tried doing stuff to myself, but i am too much of a coward to finish the job. parents found out, but that died down. when we broke up, i had a tough time and everything was going wrong, but that was okay because i deserved it. i wanted to suffer, but now things have started to get better in my life and i hate it. i hate that i am alive and god is not punishing me more. i feel like i need her permission to live. i like to starve myself, dunk my head in ice water, or do something so i do not go insane. my counsellor ignored my last email after i missed her call.i do not want her to be sad because of me. she was so nice and i broke her. she said she forgave me, but i want to make it right. i wish we never met, so she could still be smiling. i am so sorry.sometimes, i feel like this is the only life i have so i have to accept reality. but i did something unforgivable and at the moment, i cannot handle reality.i wrote this very fast in an emotional state so forgive any mistakes in it. i am a piece of shit",Suicidal,483

"resentment towards attractive people i'm sure i'm not alone with this problem, but i've been feeling this way for so long i don't even understand how healthy people avoid these feelings.

let's say an attractive girl posts hot pictures on social media. i believe it's natural that this sort of content sparks great desire in any guy. i think it's also safe to say that 90% of guys will never have a chance with a girl like that. so i'd say it should be normal for these guys to feel some resentment, unfulfillment, jealousy, sadness, self-doubt etc.

this isn't, however, what i'm observing in reality. generally these kind of content on social media receives countless upvotes and praise from guys.

"my checkup was a success (long post) **the background story:** since i was diagnosed over 10 years ago, i've needed continuous/ongoing treatment and consultation. changing dosages, trying new medication, talking through the most current triggers, how to recognize, avoid, cope, and foster healthy decisions. gone through 4 doctors... when i was able to get an appointment and afford the treatment. i've gone some years withdrawing, some entirely unmedicated, new medication, lower dose/higher dose, self medicating at times. having bipolar is truly debilitating and scary. emotional (mood) symptom wise, last year was not as intense as i've experienced before. but last year was indeed the shittiest fucking year i have lived through in my entire life thus far. i won't list everything that was shitty. you guys know last year was horrible. my mom almost dying before her liver transplant probably topped my list though. and my bipolar mania has decided to manifest entirely through my secondary symptoms of ocd. chronic anxiety has taken over my usual depression and has crash landed directly on one main symptom. [self excoriation/dermatillomania/compulsive skin picking.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/excoriation_disorder) no exaggeration, i look like the picture in that wikipedia link, just add breasts and some curves. i'm not looking for advice or guidance. i've been receiving the professional version steadily over a year and a half now. i just know that csp is not common in this sub, is often not associated with bipolar, and is still considered co morbid along with symptoms of ocd.

**the point of my post.:** i saw my psychiatrist today. and he agreed that i have had very significant improvements since i last saw him. my episodes have been less frequent, less intense, and my depression has also eased up. my mania still keeps me awake throughout the week (i get 3-4 hrs sleep at a time around 4-7am.) and i literally sleep all weekend. but my job hasn't been suffering, i've made three trips from the west coast to texas for some extremely intense circumstances, i've lost 30lbs, and reduced my ""skin picking"" from my legs and lower arms to just my upper arms, back, and face although my face has had dramatic improvements as well. 

**my checkup achievement:** for the first time since i can remember, my doctor isn't changing my medication and has said that i don't need to schedule a follow up appointment at this time. i will continue to have a steady supply of my personal med cocktail without worrying about running out. i'm under no obligation to pay for, schedule, drive to, or stress about coordinating  my life around another psych appointment until i feel it's necessary.

**tldr: some years/some decades are worse than others. if you can't remember the last time you caught a break, don't give up. we all deserve peace and stability. today was my day.**",Bipolar,471

"i have been having a very difficult 8 months, in all the ways possible and had been contemplating taking my life for basically the entire time. it is not something i have really talked to many people about, and had been working to see a therapist as soon as possible, but have been having issues thanks to insurance. i kept telling myself ""if i feel this way in 3 months, then i will look into my options to end the pain."" and 3 months came and went, and i still felt that way. 6 months passed and i would find myself laying in my bed with tears in my eyes, watching the latest news of how humanity is destroying itself and wishing i was not alive. 8 months went by in a depressive fog and i continued trying to give myself hope for a future, with very little luck. it has felt like despite trying to do everything right, nothing has gone right or even slightly in my favor. this morning i felt the urge to end my life stronger than i have felt in my adult life. in a puddle of tears, contemplating how to take my life i asked myself ""what am i even living for anymore?"" and my phone rang. my phone id showed the caller was my beloved sister who i have not talked to in months. i could not bring myself to tell her my mental struggles, but hearing her voice saved me. and without knowing what i was going through, she delivered the words i needed to hear most. she gave me hope again when i felt it was all but lost. from one sad heart to another, *please* do not give up hope. the people who love you would miss you more than could be put into words. (i know this bc i have survived many suicides in my life and each one hurt in ways i still have not been able to fully process.) it may feel rough today, tomorrow, and possibly for years to come. but it does get better. just remind yourself that you *can* do hard things, even if the hard thing is an internal battle with yourself. but if you give up that fight you do not end the pain, you just gift the pain to anyone who has ever loved you.my only advice is do not struggle alone, it makes everything so much harder. call someone, anyone you know that cares, call a crisis hotline, write an anonymous post, go do something you love, try something new, but especially treat yourself with kindness. you are not required to be happy every second of every day of your life. you are human, and the human experience is a messy one. so, be messy, love. do not lose hope.",Suicidal,470

however, now, i am... fine. i am not depressed. which i was expecting, because i would always crash. i had an horrible depression that lasted 4 years, and it was packed with anxiety and panic attacks... it messed me up. i didn't finish school, nor do i have a job. i am a 23 yo that can't get its life right because of a crippling depression and anxiety. but for the very first time ever since my 13s (yes, i had panic attacks this long), i am feeling fine. but this is scary? i am not sure if sertraline is dealing with my depression and is doing a good job at it. but the fear of getting manic again because of sertraline is making my anxiety peak at night. last night i woke up 4 times because i was hearing my dad call me, and then it was my mom, but really they weren't saying things... it was my imagination. but while i feel fine, this fear is so, so bad. i always think ""am i hallucinating again?"". 



thoughts like ""in a few days i will either be depressed or manic again"" makes me extremely worried. and so is my family. they are very supportive, and they felt so powerless last time it scared them to death. every time i say ""i am so happy today"" my mom asks me if i had a good night of sleep or if i am feeling like a bit high. same for my sister and my dad. questions like ""you okay? for real?"" is turning out to be too common.

"i am working myself to death, purposely. autistic with adhd. 37, no family of my own or relationships, moved back with aging parents because isolation became too much to the point i started planning my suicide.

i have nothing in my life but work, my job pays the bills. and after i finish my 9-5, i work on a couple of projects that are both artificially keeping me alive because they give me some goal or purpose but at the same time are killing me because between my job and this i spend around 14 hours a day frying my brain in front of a computer.

i used to be in shape, but i have relinquished that part of me as well since it serves no purpose anymore. i gave up on relationships, dating and love, and it is a waste of time and effort since i invest that energy on my projects or resting, and well my best years are behind me and entropy is doing its thing anyway.

"2 swollen lymph nodes...still freaking out about 2 weeks ago, i noticed a pea-sized growth under my skin in the inguinal groin region, then another. was mis-diagnosed at first as a hernia, went to doc and they said if i threw up, go right to er. 

next morning, threw up 3 times (from anxiety probably), went to er. they poked me, said ""these are swollen lymph nodes, better order some tests."" so, i got bloodwork, a ct scan and an ultrasound. lymphoma, or another cancer is my ultimate fear. 

everything came back normal. just two enflamed lymph nodes on the ct scan. they diagnosed it a probable bacterial infection, maybe given to me by the cat i got a week before all of this started. gave me antibiotics.

so i am about two weeks out from that, finished my antibiotics and the nodes are still the same size. have been to gp twice since the er, thinking i felt more nodes, he said all seems normal, and it could take a month for the nodes to go down, and they may never go down. he says he doesn't think i have lymphoma and is almost convinced fully of it. 

made the mistake of reading that only a biopsy can detect cancer, so have now convinced myself i have cancer somehow, despite 3 er docs and a nurse telling me it probably wasn't. the nodes are still about the same size, maybe bigger, but not by much. this is kilin me.

"this may sound dumb, but i miss feeling sad. when i felt sad i felt more of a drive to try do something about it. now i just feel nothing, the days just go by and seem as useless as the last no matter what i end up doing. i spend all of my time trying to just get time to pass. for what i do not know i have nothing to look forward to. i then start feeling like i am just wasting my fucking time. any effort i put ends up being a reminder that i cannot enjoy anything, which makes me want to not try and the cycle continues. i used to be able to handle my sadness much better when it was more obvious that was how i was feeling, i would be creative and be more willing to fight against it to get better. nowadays its just doing whatever takes the smallest amount of effort just enough to keep me occupied. i feel like i am letting people around me down, and i am digging myself a deeper hole.i can see myself already regretting all this wasted time if i manage to get out of this, but i honestly feel like there is nothing i can do about it. wasting time",Depression,216
"uneven pupils on friday i was looking in the mirror and noticed that my left pupil is much larger than my right. the vision in that eye is also blurry. 
i visited an optometrist today who dilated my eyes and confirmed that the left is more dilated than my right, but he didn't know why. he assumed that its something i've always had but only noticed now, but that's impossible because for the past year i have been obsessively checking my pupils in the mirror to make sure i haven't had a stroke (hello health anxiety). 
a few days before the uneven pupils, i woke up with a painful pulled muscle on the left side of my neck, could that be related? i also have occasional tinnitus in the left ear, usually pulsatile (rushing noise). 
 i'm afraid its either a carotid dissection/stroke, or some sort of tumor. maybe i had a seizure in my sleep that cause the pulled neck muscle and the eye issue? 
anyway i just wanted to vent and see if anyone else has had weird eye issues or fears. its tough to have all these thoughts in my head without anyone listening or taking them seriously. ",Anxiety,200

"health anxiety after panic attack almost a year ago, i had a panic attack that i thought was a heart attack. i've never had either, and at the time i didn't know that panic attack symptoms can mimic heart attacks. i had a friend take me to the er, and i was freaking out in the er while waiting to be seen. i remember thinking ""man, this is it, this is how i'm going to die and i'm away from family, wife and kids and everyone i love and i'm stuck in a place i hate"" and it scared me so badly. anyway, since then i've almost had myself convinced that i was going to die and it was going to be from a heart attack. i've been prescribed buspirone and it keeps me from having panic attacks, and i've come a long way from the panic attacks every day to almost having none. there's been a few times in the past few months where if i wasn't taking medication, i could've had a pretty bad attack. one of them was last week, where my mind just kind of ran away while i was driving home from work and for some reason my mind was looping ""you're gonna die, and probably run into oncoming traffic, look now you're barely breathing"" and i had to calm myself down. it sometimes takes me a really long to get calm, and sometimes i can calm myself almost immediately. the thing about this though that i really hate is that the anxiety is always there, always either in the back of my mind or i'm actively thinking about it. i've set an appointment with a psychologist for a few weeks from now, and i really want to get off the meds. they have some side effects that i really don't like, and they are considered mild. are there any of you who suffer from the same kind of health anxiety that i do? i don't know anyone personally who does, at least not in the way it is with me. some co-workers had anxiety issues in the recent past, but it looks like i'm the only one who suffers 24/7 and it looks like it's a permanent thing in my life.

"i'm a lot scared about my mom's lower leg pain hi! first of all, i made a second account to talk about these personal issues, i use my personal account (which has my real name) for a lot of public things and didn't feel comfortable in sharing those personal issues there.

&amp;#x200b;

my mom had breast cancer six years ago, and treated it successfully, doing chemo and radiotherapy. fortunately, it was diagnosed very early. she is totally cured now, and constantly monitors her breast and

 thyroid (which she had some benign cysts). she is 60 and doesn't smoke or drink at all.

&amp;#x200b;

last week, she removed a dot on her face. the biopsy returned basal cell carcinoma, but with no spread on close lymphs. the dermatologist said it was nothing to worry about.

&amp;#x200b;

but yesterday she said she had been felling pain around the tibia for about a year and half. it's a pain she feels deep, that comes for some time (like a week), then disappear for some months, then comes back. it doesn't seem to be affected by exercise, but hurts at night. while she was pressing the region to show me where it was, she said she could feel it hurt a little, even if, at that moment, it wasn't hurting the way it used to. there is no swelling at all, and she said it never was. she also said the pain is the same since it begun. 

&amp;#x200b;

and she had been having some cramps a while ago, the doctors said it could be a neuropaty caused by the medications she took, like tamoxifen. she also said these cramps usually stops when this pain begins.

&amp;#x200b;

she said she's worried about it being a bone metastasis from the breast cancer.

&amp;#x200b;

from what i know, it's extremely unlikely that a metastasis from a cancer she treated back in 2013 (and which, in that time, had no secondary tumor detected) could only appear now. 

&amp;#x200b;

but i'm extremely worried about other cancer possibilities. like a primary bone cancer, or a secondary cancer from a hidden tumor that originated in other part of the body.

&amp;#x200b;

the rational part of me says it's probably neuropaty, or even some other symptom caused maybe by her age, and if that pain was bone cancer, she probably would be gone now, or at least the pain would have gotten worse after all this time, or even some swelling would have appeared.

&amp;#x200b;

but the other part (the same that worried about me having als because of some twitches) says it could be cancer. she has an appointment with the same doctor that treated her cancer on monday, but, until then, i can't help but be terrified about this possibility.

&amp;#x200b;

i now spend hours reading the criteria for bpd, taking bpd symptom tests over and over again, reading accounts of bpd on medical/mental health subreddits, to see if my experiences fit. it's even more hellish than health anxiety i've had about physical health problems because there is no definitive test, one professional could say i have it and the other could disagree for example, there is no objective qualification for whether i ""have"" it and i'm scared to even bring it up to a professional because i don't want to plant the seed in their mind and be treated worse because it's so highly stigmatized. it's gotten completely obsessive. i'm really unsure of what to do.

"my new insurance considers my meds ""preventative"" so i thought this was interesting and also maybe a little sign of attitudes towards mental health changing.  i got new insurance and was looking through the list of ""preventative"" medications, the ones covered at 100% and don't cost you anything, to see if anything i was taking was on the list.  (it never is, but always worth a check.)

first i searched depakote.  to my surprise it was listed, but as an epilepsy medication.  my first thought was whether or not they knew i wouldn't be taking it for epilepsy and i would get away with getting it for free!

next i searched for cymbalta, and it was there!  listed as an antidepressant.  in fact they had nearly all your antidepressants on there.  lithium is on the list and even some anti anxiety meds.

sure enough, when i filled my prescriptions, they were free.

i mean it makes good business sense.  i am more expensive if i end up in the hospital.  just like quitting smoking drugs are frequently covered because you're a lower risk if you quit.

for some reason it just made me feel good.  like hey, it's just an illness and we know you need meds to keep it under control.  no big deal.  or something.  it also made me very people for everyone under this plan because while i do not currently have any issues paying for my meds, i know what it's like to be in that position and it's horrible.  it's nice to know everyone i work with who needs this kind of medication can get it and maybe this is a new trend we will start seeing with insurance companies like smoking cessation drugs.  fingers crossed.",Bipolar,291

"hello. first post ever on reddit(i think)sorry in advance for this banter, but i do not feel like i can tell my friends about this nor do i want to post this where any fanily member can see. i am going to get straight to the point. i sometimes just want to die. let me start by telling you abit about myself.i had a pretty though childhood growing up, my dad commited suicide when i was 5, and my mother remarried a man who was very abusive towards me and my siblings. she later divorced him when i was 17.i am nie 24 years old, never been in any serious relationships, not as lovers nor as friends. still a virgin(not that it bother me much). i just want to make this clear, i am not exactly unatractive i think. i am pretty tall, strong jawline, pretty muscular and heavily tatted also i have a talent for music. but i do not feel like any of that matters. call me narcissistic if you like, but it is the truth. the reason i say it does not matter is because it does not. alot of people feel like if they look good they will be happy, but that is completely false, atleast in my case. the reason i want do die is because nothing i ever do makes me feel fullfilled. once i pick something up i usually stick with it for a while and tend to develop a talent for it, but usually end up dropping it as i do not feel any fullfilment from it. i cannot develop any romantic interest for anyone, nor form any real connections. i just really want to day dream and live in my own world. the fantasy world i created feels like my sactuary. that is why i want to die sometimes. i do not know how or when but somewhere down the line i convinced myself that when i die i will live in the universe i created inside my head. i do not know why i have not killed myself yet. maybe because friends and family will be sad, may have because my cat will be left alone(which is what i care the most about in this world). it feels like i am just waiting for a meaningful event that will bring joy to my life which will never happen. any one else feel like this? anyways, sorry for making you read this drunken useless banter. have a nice day i sometimes want to die.",Suicidal,423

"i have struggled with mental illness my whole life. from the early age of 6 i was diagnosed with anxiety and ocd. later on at about 10 i was diagnosed with adhd, and than a few years later diagnosed with depression. my first depressive episode took place when i was on middle school, and after seeing a therapist weekly and going on meds i soon became happy and content with my life. however, a few years later (now) i (f17) decided to try and go off my meds. talking to my parents, doctor, and therapist, we decided to give it a try. and for the first month or so, i was completely fine. nothing was wrong, and i felt good. but i soon after had fell into a depressive episode. my trigger was, and had been the time before, an internal feeling that i was not good enough. this time the trigger had been not getting a part i wanted in a show i was acting in, pushing all these intrusive thoughts into my head. the main one that i have struggled with however is the thought of suicide. i do not know why. i do not want to die, i do not want everything to end, but i cannot shake the thought. and over the next few months, it just got worse. i ended up getting into a relationship with a guy from school and we have been dating for almost 3 months. over this time though i have developed rocd to the point where i think of my bf and i immediately feel miserable. i feel so bad because he likes me so much, and i cannot stop with all the rocd intrusive thoughts. it got to the point where i would nervous vomit every time i knew i was going to see him. i have no idea what to do. i have ruined multiple events/vacations/parties for myself by just ruminating on the rocd thoughts of whether i actually like him or not or if were supposed to be together. i have just fucked up the past few months of my life and relationship. since then, i have gone back on my meds and am seeing my therapist more frequently. me and my bf are currently on a break, but we are meeting up to decide on what to do in 3 days. i have genuinely been better when i have been able to focus on myself, but i really do not want to break up with him, however hard the relationship might be. i have major guilt from the depression and rocd thoughts and i do not know what the next step to take is. i have been having these thoughts since we first started dating, so how do i know this is just rocd, or are me not meant to be together? my depression has ruined my relationship with my bf and myself",Depression,487
"is it bad if your antidepressants makes you feel happy (i'm not talking about dangerous mood elevation)? i'm not talking about mania or hypomania here. but in the past i increased my escitalopram dose a few times. i was really ""climbing the ladder"" dose-wise (i think that i had to increase the dose over and over in order to keep the ""happy"" effect going) so i had to quit and come back down to the proper dose. i felt unbelievably great as i increased the dose. i took notes on my experience and i was just saying how great i felt and how i had nice memories of my family and my past...my mood was just great.

antidepressants have been in use for a while now so i'm sure there's some wisdom about (1) whether being happy like that is sustainable, (2) whether it's healthy or not, and (3) whether i could've actually ended that phenomenon of chasing the effect up the ""dose ladder"" and gotten the effect to ""stick"".

most importantly, when the ""happy"" effect was in place all my adhd medications were working. this was absolutely life-changing. i can read in my notes that it says over and over ""if i could only maintain this level of healthy brain-functioning and adhd-medication effectiveness then i would have a great life"". i wonder if there's anything to be learned from this whole experience that i had with the escitalopram and the adhd medications; maybe the experience can provide a clue as to what to try in order to have a sustainable foundation for my adhd medications.

i do have some anxiety/depression/ocd; i don't think that it's at the clinical level. i mean, i looked up the criteria for ocd and one of them said something about the issues taking up an hour of your time each day, so i'm far from that. and when it comes to depression and anxiety, it's a situation where i have mild issues where you could probably say that it's unhealthy for me to have the negative tilt to my emotions that i have...again it's nothing clinical, though.",Anxiety,353

"i have been depressed for as long as i can remember. i also have severe anxiety. i feel out of control right now. the intrusive dark thoughts are eating me up and i do not know what to do. i do not know what approach to take. i am scared to give medications a chance because back in 2013 i went through a very low point and was prescribed xanax. i took xanax everyday for three years. at first it helped. it really did. it helped me get out of the ditch i was in but as you all know, xanax is a short term drug. i became dependent on it rather quickly. weaning myself off of it was the best and hardest thing i had ever done. i was also prescribed lexapro. i took it one day and a couple hours later i was a wreck. dizzy like you would not believe. i could even stand. i had to miss work. i gave it up after that. ever since then i have not been on a single drug. i also did not have health insurance so there is that too. i am in a better position now, though. i have health insurance. i am working a full time job. things are better. but i cannot shake how i feel. it has been so bad lately and i cannot breathe. life should not be this way. i should not wake up and immediately think of negative things. hateful, dark thoughts. its miserable. i am constantly anxious. my heart is always racing. i am uncomfortable in my own skin. i have slowly become scared to leave the house. i need to think about it and prep myself beforehand. its exhausting.i guess my question is what steps should i take? i was thinking of making an appointment with my pcp on monday. should i be open to medications again? i am so scared of becoming dependent on those things again. should i try therapy? how do i cope with my thoughts? i do not exactly have a strong support system. i feel like i do not have much longer and i need to control this now. i am losing hope and also my mind. this should not be how life is, right?",Depression,380

"13 trips to the hospital from 2018-present (went to the er last night). near trips to the hospital: almost daily. hey guys,

i am really suffering in a way that makes life absolute torture. i have health problems, however they're compounded *significantly* by my constant fears of death and cardiovascular/heart-related health anxiety. 

does anyone here ever feel like suicide is rational when your life has been distilled to daily panic attacks of the worst kind and constant thinking/fears of sudden death or further disability (i.e. strokes, fatal arrythmias, heart failure, etc.)

i don't want to die, i fear the unknown so intensely, however i feel that i deserve dignity and mercy for my situation. i feel like i should have the right to end my own life because of the amount of suffering i experience on a daily basis. i want to have the option to terminate my consciousness peacefully and legally under the supervision of empathetic doctors and nurses.

"thanks for being the community i never dreamt to have  

so yesterday i had a therapy session, and the therapist asked why i think  i have no friends.

i answered i have interests that few share, where i live as i live in a small city, so it is hard to have friends or form relations based on interests. also, i have no interest in sports and that is the common interest where i live 

i told him i am part of many online communities, but i just lurk as i feel that i don't belong enough to participate in  these communities even if they are based on my interests

at that moment i remembered reddit and this community, and i felt that i already have a community where i can freely be who i am without  fear

when i joined reddit it was for something tech related, then i said why not searching for avoidant and i was expecting nothing but to my surprise i found this sub, and it was unbelievable as it is hard to find anything related to avoidant

i was new to reddit and navigating it, but i was happy as i found people like me.

as i kept browsing, i started to get related more and more to your posts. i felt a connection to you,  and i realized i am not alone anymore.

knowing i am not alone anymore, is one of the greatest things anyone can ask for, it meant i have people who can understand me and my struggle and what i am going through.

people who can understand me and i can understand them.

people with who i can share whatever i want, knowing they will understand me and won't judge me 

in this community,i don't hesitate or feel shy to share anything with you

from sharing memes to asking questions and seeking help and advice

here, i share my problems and secrets that no one knows, including my family.

i finally found a home here and family 

this community really seems like an oasis in the desert 

i have more to say about this community but i want to keep this post short as possible.

my previous job was working for a guy building some side projects (mostly web3 based stuff), but we didn't run with any of them.

well, a few weeks ago he told myself and the 1 other dev he hired that he needs to focus on his primary business, since that's keeping him too busy to really get stuck into anything with us.

it's understandable and he was even awesome enough to hook us both up with jobs at a another startup.

at first i was pretty excited, since this startup is also web3 based and most of my knowledge and skills involve blockchain tech.

well, as it turns out they're primarily making use of the mean stack (more specifically ionic) and up until a few weeks ago, i had 0 experience with that stack.

my experience is primarily writing smart contracts with solidity and i would say i'm probably even above average, when it comes to it.

unfortunately for me, even though they're a web3 company, they don't need much in the way of smart contracts, and what they do need is a full stack mean dev...

i've felt like a fish out of water recently, but i've been trying my best.

for the past, nearly a month, i've been spending 70+ hours a week working and studying.

i'm pretty much either learning the tech, working, going to the gym here and there or sleeping.

i still feel like i haven't learned enough fast enough though and i'm pretty sure i'm going to lose this job...

if i do, i don't know what i'm going to do and that scares me and seriously gets me down.

i've seriously even thought about ending it all, if i lose this job.

anyway, just wanted to get that off my chest and if anyone has any advice or guidance, i'm open to anything.

thanks.",Depression,357

"i am so pissed just because i look tired and wearing dirty clothes doesnt mean im up to no good. i have already filed a complaint with the bbb, attorney general, called my bank to see if i can get that money back. im thinking while im stuck here, to contact the local news paper. this man and his housekeeper wife, whom i forgot to add, called me a ""skank"" im dead serious. so i was falsely accused and insulted, and had my money robbed.",Stress,85
"i know i am not allowed to ask this, and that this will probably get removed, but please i just want to know. i think if i do not find something easy i will probably resort to suffocation. it is painful but at least i will not be here anymore. i kind of want to stab myself as well because i feel like i deserve that. any advice is welcome, thank you. what is the best, most effective way to do it?",Suicidal,82

"throwaway because idk this group and idk if anybody will report me... but looking thru the posts here this seems to be about the only place i truly say how i feel. idk how nor why i cannot change. therapy, psychologist, meds, working out, traveling.... i have been doing it all. no one can say i have not tried.... but yet here i am. alone in an apartment with no energy left for tears for screaming. i am just numb...again... wondering how can i feel this way? wondering why i cannot accept life? why i cannot change my outlook? i feel no love for anything. frustration only. frustration to my family, women, even my dog whose done nothing. i know this frustration steams from within... but i cannot seem to beat it, like rolling a boulder up a steep hill in the rain it feels impossible. idk how i will feel tomorrow... maybe i can hold these feelings at bay for a good part of the day; but i know i will have them again as sure as the sun sets in the west. it is werid tho.... i cannot help but tell you all i love you. i do not want anyone to kill themselves. you are all worth being on this planet, but man....idk if i belong. it is a dark twist in my psychology i guess. i love you. i am so tired of not being able to change",Suicidal,242

"my baby brother was murdered brutally last year. i still cannot believe it happened, it hits me like a tsunami. i loved him more than anyone i have ever loved. and i was his star, his amazing big sister. but i have struggled with suicidal thoughts ever since i was 13. he on the other hand was so full of life and always had a smile on his face. my brother suffered from a serious illness but it never got his spirits down. all my life i wished i had the illness instead because he loved life and i did not. every time i had a suicidal thought, i would think how sad my baby brother would be, i could not bear the thought of hurting him. now i wish i was the one those men took that day. he should be here. i cannot imagine to live this life without him. i cannot believe this is my life now. my little brother was murdered, i cannot stop thinking i should have died instead",Suicidal,174

"she went through a very rough patch about a year ago and her mental health was clearly affected, she was living out of her car, she had left an abusive bf and then she had a crash in her car. for some reason she decided to go to romania for treatment. i only heard from her sporadically. once she called me and let slip that she had been raped as well as hit, drugged, something about a court case, and whay sounded to me like a lot of paranoia about mafia and government. i put this down to ptsd from her abuse.",Normal,102
