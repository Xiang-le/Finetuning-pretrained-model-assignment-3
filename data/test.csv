"i need to get out of my house. i have been very screwed up with work and hardly ever leave the house at all. it was like this before the pandemic, but this last year and a half has been worse. i would like to be able to see the sea, or a beach. or even a hotel with a pool. but i have no one to go with. i am single and i do not have any friends or family to go to. every year i think of going somewhere, and i end up leaving it so as not to go alone ... and the years go by and i lose my time ...i feel like i need to disconnect, but ... it is one thing to be alone at home in familiar terrain, with my things and so on, and it is quite another to be outside. i know it may sound stupid, but from now on, i have a hard time getting out of my comfort zone, even speaking of the physical zone, and not just emotional. i know i have to make an effort, but i do not know what to do. i feel very ... unprotected being alone and surrounded by people, especially in places that i do not know well ... i need an advice. i want to go on vacation somewhere, but i have no one to go with.",Depression,236

"having a severe panic attack, might be triggering  as  of today, i've suddenly begun experiencing a sweet taste in my mouth.  i'm a long time sufferer of health anxiety, and intrusive thoughts  compelled me to start self-diagnosing what the issue could be. while my  family has no history of diabetes, and i eat well, i saw that it could  be an early symptom for type 2 diabetes. since i've seen that, i've  convinced myself that that's exactly what it is, and that my life is  over. i'll just have to live with a future of crippling health issues  from here on out. i can't get it out of my mind, and the fear of that is  overwhelming me. i'm hyperventilating, and i don't know what i can do  to put my mind at ease. i know it's probably nothing in reality, but  this idea claws at the back of my mind, going ""what's wrong with looking  out for your health? it's better to catch these things early"" and it  compels me to look further into it, which further perpetuates the cycle.  i'm so tired, and scared, and i don't know what to do.

is it normal for only a fraction of the specified leave time to be approved? i was told i can apply for an extension but it's just filling out the same exact form with the same exact information. i'm terrified that my leave won't be extended and i'll either have to quit my job or force myself to go back much earlier than anticipated. any insight would be greatly appreciated. thank you.",Bipolar,154

the static items regarding diet are fine, i don't want to get granular there, but for tracking the emotions i feel i need to better ""standardize"" what i am trying to say.  has anyone encountered this?

for instance, i can have entries that range from ""feeling scattered"", ""feeling lost"", ""feeling confused"".  well really this is me saying i am confused.  so i was thinking of focusing on robert plutchik's theory of 8 basic emotions and sort of seeing how that works for a while.

the reason for this is so i can trend the states over time and see if that uncovers anything.

hello everyone! i made a thread about this a while back. i think i may have messed up a potential friendship with someone who is clinicially depressed. i unfriended them once whenever i thought they were intentionally ignoring me because my social anxiety kicked in.do people with clinical depression intentionally ghost? i left the door open for the guy to reach me. i want to send him positive messages but i am unsure if i will come off as needy. do clinically depressed sufferrers dislike people like that or do you think its good to still send messages even if they ignore them? is it possible to regain their trust at all or did they potentially check out whenever i unfriended and refriended them? any help is appreciated and thank you! trying to friend person struggling with depression,Depression,138

"what to say to those who you ghosted and what they might say i know some people are happy to cut ties with people, but others feel guilty or anxious about cutting ties and freeze because too much time has passed. if someone reached out to me and said something along the lines of struggling with personal things, that would be so helpful even if much time has passed. the people who you have ghosted are probably hurt and confused, and the truth is they probably internalized it as something they have said or done wrong. if they did not do anything wrong, that is something to highlight.

""hi. i just wanted you to know that i have been struggling with some personal things, and that's why i haven't reached out. i am still struggling and not ready to maintain friendships just yet. but i do want to let you know i care. i'm sorry if i have left you hurt and confused. it was not something you have done wrong."" i am not in a place to explain further, but i do hope you are well.""

some people may be understanding, and some people may still be reeling from the hurt and not respond at all, or they may decide that they do not want to open the door back up to having contact with you now or in the future because they felt that they were rejected and don't want to risk that again. rejection hurts people without mental illness, too! that is not necessarily a rejection of you, but more of a reflection of the place where they're at mentally. it may have taken them a while to move on from the relationship/friendship. some people may feel that keeping that door closed is protecting them from getting hurt again. in my opinion, that is more than a fair response so before you do reach out if you decide to, you have to mentally prepare for whatever decision someone will make. one way to look at it is you get the chance to prepare for their response when they never got a chance to prepare for being ghosted (unless you let them know you ghost at times).",Personality disorder,369

"paradoxical cycle of my past, present and future and suicidal ideation hi guys , 

so i am a bipolar and i haven't actually told anyone but few about my bipolarity. anyway i believe being a bipolar affects the way i am thinking and the decisions i make according to my emotions which are instable and which will eventually lead to a feeling of regret and guilt later.

so my problem is that now while the usual and frequent depressive episodes trigger, this depressive episode is the worst so far, i live in this paradoxical loop and cycle between my past and all these nostalgic moments i am always recalling in my mind that could make me sometimes happy but also crying because i miss these moments so much and miss the people that i don't see anymore but have been a great part in my life nevertheless left me for either no reason or with a reason that i couldn't really do anything about it, my present which is affected negatively by my nostalgia and emotions for the past and taking a great amount of time just living in the memories, living in the past and dreams instead of living in the present time, and my future which l do think about but don't care about it anymore, sometimes i used to think about my future to forget about the past but failed to do so. 

thinking about what i could do in the future makes me a bit happy nevertheless when these nostalgic moments hit me, it just converts me from a happy person to a sad, desperate and disappointed person again that eventually lead to deep depression which cause suicidal ideation, mostly to overdose to death, but ends up with failed attempts to commit suicide. i can't even determine if these memories are good or bad by now cuz it depends as well, sometimes i just get the good parts of the memories while other times i just get the tragic parts and events that happened to me as for getting bullied recently at the university, losing my best friend, losing my boyfriend ...etc. i just believe by now that good memories are even worse and more hurtful than the bad ones. it just feels like getting stabbed in the back.

these many emotions and mixed-up thoughts i get give me a headache and usually panic attacks, that sometimes i cut myself with a nearby sharp thing as well.

i also have adhd, social phobia and severe trust issues. i now feel so bad that i wish this world to stop and my life ends. thinking about suicide already makes me more comfortable to end my struggle you know. so i've been asking if i am alone on this. does anyone relate to my experience?",Bipolar,467

anyway, i'm always health anxious about things like this, but it got a lot worse last week upon receiving an email that the flu is widespread and that they've been getting a large amount of cases. people in my classes claim to have it, people in my clubs claim to have it, etc. luckily none of my five roommates (we live and share a bathroom together) have gotten it so far, but i'm still so freaked out. i obviously go above and beyond with precautions- hand washing before any kind of eating or touching my face, probiotics, vitamin c immune supplements 1x a day, lots of fruit, water, sleep, not a lot of junk food, exercise. i clean the doorknobs every day and sanitize my phone and laptop daily. i still can't help but worry.

i've been taking my temperature a lot and feeling feverish but it never comes back with a fever. i've also had some trouble sleeping and i've been nauseous, had a funky appetite, and some questionable poops. you can catch the flu through air droplets so that's the only way i think i could ever get it but i'm still really freaked out.

"personality or hypomania? i feel like how i tell about my life to my psychiatrist influence my possible diagnosis. i'm currently in the middle of diagnosis for bipolar 2. i got already medication (lamictal) even though i didn't yet get a official diagnosis, since at psychiatrist appointment we didn't have enough time to go through all the diagnosis criteria, and if my sympotoms fit in to those.

with psychiatrist we've been going through my possible hypomanias but specially been  focused on one which was the most severe one. during this period i broke up with my boyfriend (do not regret it), had  a huge crush before breakup, slept with the person i had a crush few days after breaking up, felt really happy and energetic, got involved in politics, slept 5h a night (usually 8+h), got in an out of situationships, went to parties, told everybody how beautiful i am (usually i'm not happy with my body). my psychiatrist didn't ask on my drug use but i've realized that before this episode or in the beginning of this episode i took some psychedelics. i really don't want drug use on my medical records since i've been sober for a year now. does anybody else have any feelings on drug use on their medical records?

if i tell my psychiatrist i have taken illegal drugs before the episode i might not get the diagnosis. but then again i suffer from mood swings and cyclic severe depressions. i don't know anymore what is my normal state and if i exaggerate my possibly hypomanic symptoms. i've had other hypomanic episodes as well. in one i had for few weeks i moved in with a guy for a month who i'd known for two days, didn't fly back to home even though covid-19 restrictions were starting, posted dancing videos on instagram, said i love you to the person i was living with, had unprotected sex. but again this person was very manipulative and was gaslighting me, love bombing, and getting mad for me moving out. i feel like my psychiatrist could very easily misdiagnose me since my hypomanias might be caused some other things such as drugs or manipulation. how do you feel, is hypomania something that can't be caused by other factors in your life?

whole my life, i have been doing impulsive decisions like gotten three tattoos at once (my first ones), brought flight tickets for next day, traveled by myself, applied to new schools, cheated, went to strip club (not normal to me), had hookups. on all of these i've had regrets as well. i don't know what is my personality and what not. if i tell my psychiatrist that these actions were not normal to me then i probably get the diagnosis. but also i do these things so regularly that maybe those are charasterictic to me.",Bipolar,477

"hello, i have (22f) struggled with my mental health since i was very young, i was bullied when i was a kid and developed social anxiety because of it. then i became depressed in my teenage years, but got better when i was 20.i have never been good at interacting with people, due to my anxiety i find it really hard to talk spontaneously to people, but at the same time i can get defensive over anything, like i feel people are attacking me or trying to make fun of me but in reality they are just joking around. a lot of people do not like me because of that, i seem really mean but i am not, i wish i could be friends with people like a normal person but i just cannot. lately i have been having good days and bad days, but exaggerated. when i am having a good day i feel amazing, i am productive and do a lot of things. but in my bad days i feel way too bad, i was clean (from self harm) for 4 years and i did it again like a week ago. when i feel bad i also cannot stop thinking i want to die, i feel like no one will ever like me, ill never get a job because i run away from good opportunities because of my anxiety. i just want to disappear but i do not want to kill myself because i do not want my family to suffer. tl;dr: i do not know if i am depressed or not, i have motivation a lot of days but some days i become suicidal and i think its all because of my anxiety i can feel happy some days and other days i want to die",Depression,299

"how do you combat anger? - disgust? rage? sadness? i am only fifteen. my mother drives me crazy. she makes me want to kill myself, (which may be her goal in the end) criticizing every move i make. my siblings are the opposite of me, judge mental, rude, yet so so fake. when i am in public with my mom, she masks her behavior really well. i am contemplating suicide in the future as everybodys judgements have gotten the best of me. every move i make, i doubt myself - because of them, or question what i am doing. (which i have never done before, and have always been pretty confident when making decisions/thinking for myself.) how would you stand up for yourself in my situation? i have always been closed off, afraid to say what is really on my mind.) i am not necessarily sensitive to criticism but their judgements about my appearance and whatnot have gotten the best of me. i do not connect well with most of my family, even my fathers side now, so why should i force myself to get along with people who treat me with ultimate disrespect? they are very driven by materialistic things and get overly excited about certain things/items they have gotten to touch up their appearance. i am not sure why my family has such an issue with me, slandering my name - which used to get nothing but praise. in the end, i am not going to mask my personality for ones pleasure. i absolutely despise their behavior. they are disconnected from reality, nature, etc. - and more connected with superstitions, mainstream media, popular opinions, and appearance. escaping this enclosed environment by walking has helped with stress levels, but if anybody has other tips; they would be greatly appreciated. p.s. not as if i care so much about politics, but the deranged radical leftist mentality has definitely contributed to their biased viewpoints about current events, which drives me nuts. anger, rage, disgust.",Suicidal,333

"first time posting on reddit... need help/advice/inspiration for dealing with a bipolar depressive episode hello there.

i am 23 years old and officially got diagnosed with bipolar type 1 about a year and a half ago after being hospitalized from a month-long manic episode. after that, i was on ei for 4 months and had to take a break from school. basically, it ruined my life.

the meds helped me remain stable, with a little bit of depression here and there.. nothing major. for the past 5 weeks, i have fallen into a deep depression. i am crying on the floor, feeling physically paralyzed, can't see my friends, and having very dark thoughts. 

i saw my psychiatrist and therapist last week and we upped my meds. i am now on 200mg lamictal, 60mg latuda, and 100 mg modafinil. i also started light therapy, work out 4 days a week, take vit d, iron, and omega 3s, meditate, and am starting cbt therapy next week. i feel like i'm doing all of the right things.. which is why i feel so frustrated that nothing seems to be working. oh, and i got my hormonal iud taken out as my naturopath said it might be causing my mood problems.

i don't want to die. there is so much more i want to do in life. but being severely depressed is no way to live.

people with bipolar... what med combos are you on? what other therapy has worked for you? how did you get better? i need some hope in my life right now...

"obsesssion with hepatitis c from manicures i'm a woman in her late 20s.  now that i am talking with my husband about having a baby, i'm starting to worry that i could have hep c, and could pass it to my baby.  you might think ""easy, just get tested"" but that would stress me out more than anything.  there are so many false positives, not to mention the fact that if the healthcare law changes, i could have a ""preexisting condition"" on my record.

my therapist doesn't think i should worry.  i am not a baby boomer, iv drug user, never had any blood transfusions, my only unprotected sex partner is my husband, etc...none of the major risk factors.  but i can't stop thinking about the few manicures i've gotten in my life.  i've only ever gotten about ten manicures at a salon, but i've read that this is a possible mode of transmission.  of course the logic side of my brain tells me that most women get far more than 10 manis in their life, and most women do not have hep c...but i can't stop thinking about it, especially because i've bled on a few occasions during manis (i've had probably about 20 pedicures in my life, but they were at a high end salon that showed off how well they sterilized everything)

also, i got a tooth pulled in 1997...i assume that's late enough in history for them to be sanitizing everything, but who knows?

about 4 years ago, i had a cmp blood test done and my liver enzymes showed up normal.  i assume that if i had had hep c for *that* long, something would have been amiss.  but i still can't stop worrying.

my therapist thinks i'm clinging to this because i'm secretly more worried about being a mother, or the changes a baby will bring, but i've hyperfocused on this to distract me from the ""real"" concerns....

anyway, is he right?  am i unnecessarily obsessing over this?  how often do you hear about young women with no risk factors coming down with hep c?",Anxiety,351

"squeezing feeling in my ribs hey guys. really glad i found this sub - seems really helpful! was just wondering if anybody experiences a similar symptom to what i have a lot of the time.

most of the time my body feels okay? okay enough, i guess. but once every 2/3 days i seem to get symptoms in and around my ribcage area. that entire section of my body suddenly feels very tense, and it gives me added symptoms too. when i stand up i get more lightheaded, my breathing because shallower by default, my heart races, and i sweat a ton. i also feel like there's a general squeezing action occuring around my ribcage. for example,  when i take certain breaths i can physically feel the tension in my rib area. because this area is so close to my heart, i worry that it is actually my heart malfunctioning. i hope that isn't the case and it's more to do with my ribcage area being tense or something.

the weird thing is that most of the time when this symptom comes along i'm not even nervous. it just always seems to happen in the evening when i'm watching the tv, or having just been for a walk.

what makes it worse is that it doesn't leave either. the only way i can make it stop is by going to sleep and then my body 'resetting' to normal the next morning. sex can help the issue, but other times it makes it worse too. my body just feels full of adrenaline when the symptom start.

so i was just wondering if anybody had anything similar? i just don't understand the source of it all. i'm rarely anxious mentally beforehand, but it seems as if my body is anxious. it just comes on so randomly. the problem is that from there on the symptoms it gives me are so uncomfortable that i worry about it. it makes me wonder if i have a heart problem or something along those lines. is it just all an internal anxiety attack built up from all of the tension my anxiety disorder in general gives me? is it some sort of adrenaline problem? i don't know but i desperately want to solve it because it hinders my functionality so much. i just turn into a breathless, tense mess when it hits me, and it causes me so much distress.

"i think i have always been suicidal, whether it be my younger tendencies or, now. life seems too much of a stress i dread the future and the present, i have no good or definite way to off myself, so that is probably why i have not done it yet, i have proven that i would have done it longer ago if i could do it without surviving, the lines will not help me, i am all alone at school because they have to isolate, all my friends have to except me, who is faking sick and my mom might send me to school tomorrow so ill be alone in class, doing my least favourite classes, and wondering if the future where ill have a life in finland, which probably will not do much, i have heard its quite nice and quite beautiful there. but that is not what were talking aboutwhen i was younger i sat on that wallcontemplating wondering.my mom did not take me seriously and eventually i went back to doing what i was meant to do they will not take me seriously then, and will not nowi have nothing to look forward i have no success to think aboutfuck this allsorry for wasting your time a little rant i have done",Suicidal,215

"do you feel that you fit in here? or on reddit in general? i've been mostly lurking around here for many months now, and i'm constantly seeing posts that make me feel like i don't belong, or i'm an odd one out. like other people think and communicate in a certain way that's different from my own, or have an understanding of what avpd means that clashes with my own, or they have (fairly ordinary) life experiences or achievements that seem impossible for me.

i don't know how much of it is due to the condition itself (if avpd is even the right label for my specific brand of brokenness), and how much of it is due to objective differences related to the fairly unusual path i've taken through life.

also, reddit is regarded to have a kind of 'hive mind', where posters tend to express similar views in similar ways to the point where it's difficult to distinguish individuals. i see myself as an outsider looking at that from a distance, but do any of you see yourself as being a part of that?

if you don't feel you fit in, why is that, specifically? what details about you clash with what you perceive as the reddit or r/avpd culture(s)?

and if you do feel you fit in, especially on reddit in general, how does that relate to your avpd? is it easier to wear a metaphorical mask as a part of a collective, something like that?

"i gave up my old career in return for a happier, healthier life. i went to medical school as a healthy, bright 18 year old, but within the first year i had my first major depressive episode and suicide attempt. at 19 i had my first manic phase - a month long binge with multiple sexual partners, drug use, and irrepressible urges to study all night. spontaneous and irresponsible acts were my forte; i decided that morocco was my spirit country, and whisked myself off the next day. i gained a reputation amongst my friends as mercurial and fun, but inside i was imploding; my second suicide attempt followed the month after.

in my mind the problem was medicine. this stressful, hypercompetitive environment was obviously causing my mood swings; no way was this an organic health problem. so i left med school at the beginning of 4th year, and began teaching maths - and i was great at it! this career change had solved all of my problems, and i was tippety top flying high fantastic! life couldn't get better, right?

wrong. the depression came back, harder than ever, sending me spiralling down into a deep, dark chasm. i was admitted to hospital and diagnosed properly, treated and sent on my way a month later, armed with mood stabilisers, cbt worksheets and a new found passion for yoga. i thought i could just ride the wave, surfing with the sun on my face when times were good, and paddling against the tide when times got bad. i never imagined i'd be dragged under again.

but i was. the stress of teaching caught up. the long hours, the constant need to be 'on' and engaging, the marking, the data tracking, the free time spent planning, the expectations, the meetings - they slowly pulled me down until i was drowning, exhausted from fighting the tide, and ready to accept defeat.

but three months ago i stopped fighting. i left teaching, and i felt the wave pull me up, lifting me toward the surface. each day that i got up was a victory that brought me closer to sunlight. i chose to leave behind the stress that was threatening my survival and anchoring me to the ocean floor and i put myself first. 

in a few weeks time i start a job working part time as an activities coordinator for the same psychiatric hospital group that i was admitted as an inpatient to. i tutor for an online company, and i'm happy.

i'm not dipping and diving on the surf with the wind rushing past, but i'm not inhaling salty foam beneath the surface either. i'm just sitting on my board, content to be.",Bipolar,451

except a few days ago, i had an incredibly terrifying panic attack. i was just lying in bed and i had this faint pain in my left arm and for some reason my brain just short circuited, i jumped up, my heart started racing which led me to think i was having a heart attack. i genuinely thought i was going to die, i felt dizzy and for the first time i couldn't calm myself down. i was terrified so i went to see my mother and i just crawled into her arms like a 20 year old baby and after a few minutes everything went back to normal. and now i'm back in the cycle again. asking myself ""what if that wasn't a panic attack?"" and other completely illogical questions. i keep checking my heart beat, sometimes i get a spike of anxiety when i think it's too slow and same for when i believe it's too fast.

i am on 150mg/day of seroquel. been on that dose i believe for about 8 months. i was also in a car crash around the same time i started on this dose, prior to that i was taking 25mg every few days for sleep. 

i've noticed since then that i am having awful muscle aches and pains. i noticed it in my back first and got physio thinking it was from the car accident (which wasn't a bad accident but i didn't know what else it could be). the physio helped some but i'm noticing other muscles are hurting a lot, every day. my right arm will get numbness a fair amount and extreme pain. i'll also have random areas (eg. lower leg) that will start hurting for a day then go away. is this common? could it be the seroquel? i want to come off it but not sure how fast i can do so.

"hi everyone, first time poster!maybe this is a post for some commiseration, but does anyone feel awesome, interesting, cool and not boring for long stretches and people always see you as that but then one day, you start overthinking things and the complete opposite feelings occur? it is especially worse when you clearly are in the wrong mindset and low self-worth just consumes you and no one, even close people, detect that? it feels like there is an asshole version of yourself inside your brain that constantly deflects all positive thoughts about you and intercepts it all. i am doing cbt and seeing a therapist every week, but i hate how these feelings rush over you and consume all of the progress you have made. i met this really cool girl 2 weeks ago and we have been having such a vibrant, interesting conversation and we have so much in common and looking forward to do things together. however, yesterday i smoke some weed with some friends (who i actually am trying to ween away from due to their different values, toxic men, etc.) and then all of a sudden i am having these feelings of not being good enough or cool enough for this dope girl i met. i am a man by the way and i find toxic masculinity to be something i really do not want to be a part of but i feel i am surrounded by men like that in my life. i am always looking at articles and posts about traits that are uncharismatic or make someone boring, and i objectively do not feel like any of those characteristics define me, but it still sucks that for every three giant leaps you take in confidence, it takes one day to have it crash down. my little brother yesterday told me i am extremely confident, and have been all of my life, and my coworkers always know i have a fun personality. how does one remind themselves that they are as cool and awesome as everyone around them? every time i feel like i am on a stretch of happiness, one day will take me right back into feelings of low self worth",Depression,368
tw suicide yea so my recent symptom of depression wa that i thought i wa really really old i m lol there were numerous occasion where i had to convince myself of my actual age because my brain wa certain i m or had to count year from my birthday and repeat to myself over and over that i m i thought most of it wa because i m seeing a lot of successful people on social medium younger than me and because i m not finished with my uni yet because i m repeating a year but during therapy today i realized that beyond those reason i also had this subconscious plan in my head that i will barely make it past 0 like top and then i will be dead i have no idea where it came from i m not suicidal i don t think i ever wa but my brain seems convinced that by the time i m 0 i will develop suicidal thought and then before i will kill myself no wonder i thought i wa so old i have a little more than 0 year before my deadline lol and that s being generous idk why i wrote this i will probably delete this later i just needed to dump this info somewhere i don t want to worry my friend and family,Depression,229

"the chicken or the egg. for me it feels like the divorce. as she was the only person on this entire earth aside from my long dead parents that actually loved me. its very easy for people who have people that love them, tell people who could disapear without a trace that ""they matter"". no f%@\* you. just f$#% you. if your someone who tells people they matter who are not loved, you do not get it. your scum. you encourage suffering is all you do. leave the suicidal alone and let them die. let them out of their misery. your guilt tripping is worse than noose. and (to be honest i do not think i would have a funeral) like literally it might be days or weeks until a next of kin is even notified. the first next of kin is incoherant and brain dead too so that will go over well. anyways, from 2010-2020, seven (7) close family members croaked. the deaths became so common mixed with my divorce by the end i did not even cry. my nightmare is when i wake up, my life is when i dream. literally. my nightmares are so pleasant because i am actually back as my old self before all the dying, and the divorce, and the emptiness and being left with nothing, or nobody. i coped with the divorce by eating myself into obesity so reproductive prospects are gone making a second marriage an impossibility. its simply over. i have fought it, i have held on for miracles, but none are coming. i am going to blow my brains out soon. the first time i was too scared. but the next time i will not back down. i have no friends. i have been homeless for 2 years because i literally do not care. i am homeless because that is where i belong. if someone would pass me a gun right now id make abstract art on the wall with it. life is not precious. its merely something lucky people get when they have social capital. if you have nothing, there is no reason. reason is someone saying ""i love you"" and actually meaning it. sure lots of the guilt trippers will drop their jesus bros or love yourself bro, or some other meaningless slogan or irrelevant commentary. cya on the otherside. decided",Suicidal,393
"i was diagnosed with bipolar ii yesterday. i guess it's my life now. hey everyone, i (18m) have had a mental illness all my life. that being adhd. i was on medication for it for about eight years, until last year, when i began to feel... different.

my adhd used to consist of hyperfixation, hyperactivity and inability to concentrate- so normal adhd stuff, but last year before i graduated high school in may, i noticed something was changing. i assumed it was my adhd, just evolving with new symptoms as i got older but towards graduation time and shortly thereafter, i realized i was wrong. 

it began to get worse with huge depressive episodes, i would cry, or feeling like crying some days, and be fine the next. and i would feel worthless, like i didn't mean or contribute anything, and then have confidence that soared through the roof. i started snapping on people and then being okay the next second. 

the anger and mood swings problems got worse within the past few months. i work retail, and i've been showing attitude and anger and even hatred one moment, and then i'm super happy and energetic the next second. even outside of work, i snap at my parents, my best friend and have constant negative emotions. i have started talking super-super fast without realizing, and feel like my thoughts are going a million miles an hour. (my psych mentioned this to me yesterday). 

one of the biggest things that coincides with the anger and mood swings is my impulse control and motivation. one thing i lack is impulse control, i know something is wrong, but i still choose to do it anyway. this has affected me with porn, gaming too much, and most importantly- spending. i have credit cards and i paid them off a month ago, and once again i have a huge balance on both, because i know i shouldnt be spending money, but in the moment it feels like i should. also the lack of motivation issue is *huge*. i want to go to the gym, i want to go out and do things, but i just *can't* no matter how hard i force myself to try.

after an argument with my mom about how she's worried about me and how she knows something is wrong, i came clean and told her that i've been keeping how i've been feeling from her, my dad, sisters, and my psychiatrist and therapist. i was afraid to be on new medicine and to be diagnosed with something new. my psych told me that sometimes adhd can evolve or even be mistaken for bipolar, since the two share similar symptoms. i was put on latuda yesterday, and i feel no difference yet, since it takes 3 weeks or more to do so, but i'm hopeful. and hopefully i can learn to live with this since it's a part of me now.",Bipolar,490

"tldr: reccomending my favourite movie that i finally watched in the middle of my depression and suicidal tndancies. now hear me out. but the last samurai. loads of people rip on it for not being historically accurate in places and having a few hollywood movie tropes. but when i came across this movie on tv and just watched it.. i was laying in bed all day everyday so upset with myself i was frustrated and wanting to cry but could never do it. it made me self harm out of frustration sometimes. but most of the time i was just numb laying down staring at the ceiling with the tv on in the back. as i was watching it i was relating to tom cruises character more and more. (suicidal and alcohol abusing man struggling with his past) it was the first thing that broke me out of constantly thinking in my head for months. watching the movie. seeing this man struggle and only end up doing the same thing over again hit home. then getting captured broke the cycle, he started recovering from his alcoholism and started caring about things. started caring for the child of the man he killed. he was finding a purpose. i always never understood people that say ""this book changed me"" ""this person snapped me out of it"" how can something just make you 180 on your feelings. but this movie started doing it for me. i was drawn in. getting hope for this character and rooting for him. then in the final battle scene, seeing this man that was broken, fighting for something he truly believed in. i am not ashamed to say i actually cried. i cried for about an hour. i was so happy that i was crying it made me cry more. like i said before i always thought it was stupid or just a lie when people say stories or people just make them snap out of it. but this did it for me in a way. it was not overnight but it put the wheels in motion that there was hope. its possible. i encourage you to watch it. it might not work. you might find it boring. or you may be lucky like me and it snaps you out of your own mind and make you feel emotion again. please keep trying it can get better. this movie helped me",Suicidal,403

"definitely depression, but could there be something else too? (thanks in advance!) i'm in my early 20's, currently a full-time student, currently seeing a counselor at my university for the depression i had from october-early february.

some background: *had an emotionally and sometimes physically abusive father growing up

*had cycles of depression as a teen but nothing as bad as this past fall, never before gotten treatment for it.

*used to have anger issues that i've been working on and have mostly gotten better.

*i used to be and still have worries in the back of my mind about some new super bug plague wiping out humanity, apocalyptic scenarios (before dystopian books were a thing-- or at least before it was on my radar), generally was and am irritable at times (can't stand foot/leg bouncers/tappers and gum smacking--as a result i feel pretty trapped in lecture halls). something that also seems to stand out to me is that a year or two ago i got uncontrollably angry (literally shaking mad) at my roommate for no reason and had to go on a really long walk.

currently: during my depressed period i had foggy cotton ball brain, couldn't concentrate, trouble sleeping and staying asleep, the irritability, suicidal thoughts all the time, racing thoughts.

early last week i kinda started feeling better, one day everything looked more vivid. that sounds weird, but color had a touch more color, bright things were more bright. the next day i was so elated and have been ecstatic each morning. waking up has been easy for the first time in a long time. i'm not riddled with self doubt or constantly wondering if i'm annoying people by talking to them. i'm actually excited for my future. i got cheap new clothes that fit so i don't have to wear my sweatpants every day any more.

today i woke up early, did a bunch of errands, got more clothes, ran for the first time since september, did my usual short workout routine twice, and even went to an event at my university.

it's nice to finally be happy, but it feels wrong to be this happy so suddenly after having suicidal thoughts all day every day.

i meant to talk to my counselor about all this this morning but she was out sick---so instead i am asking for any personal experience or thoughts on this to see if i might be way off base or not here. ",Bipolar,410

"i feel like a failure because i've had to move home to deal with my mental illness i've been just fine living abroad for over a year, but i came home for the holidays with the intent to move on to another country afterwards. but in the last week or so before i came home, my mental health dropped off a cliff. and it has continued to fall. and now i'm having to change my entire life plan because i need to take care of this so badly that i need to stick around my hometown while i seek therapy. this is such a sudden change from everything that i'd had planned for months, and now i feel like a failure because i have to move back and stick around to deal with my stupid mental illness. like, as it is, i'm depressed as hell, and feeling this sense of failure on top of that is only making it worse. i have an intake appointment with a local counseling center next week, so i am actively working on getting help, but everything still sucks. 

now i have to find a car, a job, and an apartment (i can't handle living with my parents for longer than a couple of weeks), which are factors that i hadn't planned for at all. i have a love/hate relationship with my hometown - i've fantasized about getting the fuck out of here ever since i was, like, 14 years old, and it breaks my heart that when i finally made a huge move that i'd been wanting to make for years (living abroad), i now have to cut that plan short to deal with this mental illness shit. which is why it feels like failure: i tried something that i'd been wanting for so long, and just when i thought that i'd made it, i ended up stuck back here to deal with factors beyond my control.

so the point of this is part vent, but part ""has anyone ever felt like this?"" and if the answer to that is yes, ""any tips on what to do about it?""",Bipolar,355

"colon cancer anxiety hey all. i've been losing my sleep worrying about this. last week i've had bouts of diarrhea, they ocurred around the same time for 3 days or so. after that, i've had constipation, and i'm still suffering from it. i can pass stools with a lot of straining, but they're really small, rabbit like (no blood).
also, last friday night i woke up very suddenly and threw up. that was the only time this happened though, and i had eaten out all day (a thing i don't usually do) but it still makes me worry.

i should also add i've started taking paxil again last tuesday after tapering off of it in january due to my anxiety. i've read that it might cause some of the stuff i'm feeling, but i never had those the first time i took it, so i can't help but think i have cancer or something.",Anxiety,154

"never talked to somebody hello everyone, i'm slowly losing touch with reality. i don't know if it's important, but i've been diagnosed with depression and social anxiety since 2018, when i was hospitalized for six months due to burnout. since then, i don't know if i'm truly happy or just pretending unconsciously. i started dating my boyfriend in 2019, but we broke up in late 2021 when he cheated on me with my best friend's ex-girlfriend. it was the first time i lost control over my actions and thoughts. i was sometimes treated as the perpetrator, even though i was just existing. in that state, i stopped eating and felt no energy to nourish my body, and even when i tried, i couldn't. i was on the brink of doing something stupid, fully aware of how foolish it was. thankfully, i ended the relationship. i distracted myself with friends, some of whom were also going through breakups. i learned that alcohol could help me cope with my social anxiety, at least for a few hours, where i could enjoy the happy feelings without overthinking. i did this for about 10 months almost every weekend with friends, and it helped me try new things and gain new experiences. however, i always had a nagging feeling that grew into a thought. as i try to be the motivator in the group and the ""funny person,"" i feel like my problems are underestimated externally, and i'm becoming lonelier each week. i realize that i couldn't confide in anyone with all my thoughts. i always talked about my problems objectively but never let myself break down because i felt it would be too exaggerated and too intense. now that i miss those weekends, i feel more isolated every week. i also have other things that bother me at home, making it hard to feel comfortable. my parents also only understand depression as a common cold that should be cured after hospitalization. i don't know what to do anymore; i feel like a stone.",Depression,339

"missing my old dreams. this is a bit of a rant but had to get it out. so i always dreamed of being a professional musician as i got older as like a full time thing. i played instruments since i was in grade 4, i was a very talented musician( not saying that in a pretenious way). music was my life, i was part of jazz music programs inside and out of school , wind orchestras, scored perfectly on all my nyssma performances ( new york state music association) even skipped a few levels because i was advanced. and part of all county band programs(a hand selection of students to be part of a large bad group that would perform in front of 100's of people). i then moved on to get a scholarship to a music college, i however decided to join the army instead and became a profession musician for them for 8 years, performing for presidential speeches, veterans day and st.patrick day parades in nyc, played half time shows at nfl games etc. i used to love just sitting at a piano and letting the music flow through me, sure i wasn't the best in the world, but the raw emotion i put into my music was just a feeling i can't even explain, now it's been over 4 years since i've touched sn instrument and i just feel so empty about it. my living situation makes it difficult to practice playing and i just miss it so much. i just want to make music again and my depression is holding me back and i hate it.... i'm so sorry for rambling i just had to get it out, best of wishes to all of you",Bipolar,290

people after someone has killed himself say that he was a selfish guy .. he just thought about himself .. he did not even think how his parents will feel after he has gone .. how his friends family members will feel the problem is that they do not understand the mental state of him .. he is such neglected and isolated from his real life .. so much problems in daily life daily fights with parents about his career his studies that in his subconscious he starts thinks no one gives a fuck about him .. nobody cares whether he is here or not .. even if he is gone there will be no one remembering .. because when he is alive there is no one who is with him .. so he just feels that i should go.. and that leads to a sucide. the reason why they suicide,Depression,151

but two hours ago when i came back from a walk my left back side under the rib started to hurt :/

it not a stinging pain or something that i can't manage, but it feels a little bit like back pain and is slightly pulsating i think??

it also radiates a little bit to the right side and i am feeling a bit dizzy/out of myself right now :(

i went to pee and it came out like normal without any pain, so it shouldn't be my kidneys right?

"sometimes i feel like people just will not listen to this simple truth. they always want to blame it on you being the problem. i am going to use some of my disabilities and quirks as an example. first off i was born left handed. when i was a child it was virtually impossible to find people to teach you things left handed. so i learned to do most things outside of writing right handed or tried to learn on my own. this basically cut me off from ever pursuing a career that required precise technical abilities. think surgeon, athlete, etc. i was also born with adhd, which went undiagnosed until my teen years when learned behavior becomes harder to introduce. i was repeatedly punished because i was treated like the rest of the kids. this had a rather horrible effect on me and forced my thoughts and my self inward later in life. and i believe this is where my life long depression took root. i still to this day struggle with simple tasks that neurotypicals do not even bat an eyelash at. lastly i was born with the learning disability dyscalculia. i was actually good at math when i had the time and patience to work out the numbers. i only ever had one math teacher who had patience with me and low and behold i excelled that year. the rest of my math life is full of shame, yelling, and bad grades. considering all this all i ever hear from therapists, family, and friends is its all in your head, you can do anything i can just as well but i cannot....so why is not it normal for me to be depressed? there is no fix for my two disabilities. i am doomed to be less adjusted and slower than everyone else. when almost every well paying and secure job is out of reach for you you are fucked. i am just so tired of people treating me like a worthless lazy bastard when in reality i am trying 10x harder than most of my peers. life is objectively unfair for some people",Depression,356

"since late 2018 to now, i have been battling with depression. i did not realize i had it until mid 2019 because it came to a point where i was extremely empty, starving myself, and crying almost every night. i would hurt myself and even go to this bridge that was underneath a freeway and contemplate jumping or not. school was an absolute shit show and i felt like i was learning the most pointless things while i was struggling to battle my own mind so my grades started slipping.admittedly covid was the only thing that saved me and helped me graduate since i did not have to deal with anyone and did the work on the computer and because the schools would not let the grades drop even if you did not do the work (the grades could only go up.) i started dissociating emotionally since last year. whenever anything remotely stressful pops up my brain numbs all emotions and i start to feel super disconnected from the world.as of right now, i am twenty years old and i feel like this constantly and it is really hard to connect with other people. i find it extremely weird when someone is crying because my brain has decided to disconnect all emotions when i start to feel sad or stressed out and everything just becomes meh and bland but it is been like this for so long that i do not even know if i will actually feel anything again. i do not even know why i am posting this because i do not feel like i am supposed to be here, but i guess i am just hoping that someone will see this.i literally feel like a ghost. like i was not meant to be here. i feel like the people around me are not real. i always wonder why i was brought into this world. everything feels surreal and odd. whether anyone sees this or not, if you read it, thanks. i guess i just needed to vent my thoughts on the way i feel. almost complete loss of emotions. i do not feel human.",Depression,357
"i am quite functional, i go to work and take care of myself and the apartment. the thing that bothers me most is the amount of sleep i need to get through the day. i sleep like a baby at night, anywhere from 8-10 hours but still i need a two hour nap after work. i cannot function if i do not have my daytime shut-eye. do any of you suffer from excessive sleeping? i got my blood work done and nothing was wrong. how much do you guys sleep?",Depression,90

"contemplation i'm sitting here in my trailer (i'm living at a ski resort at the moment for my job). it should be my dream job but i feel so empty and alone.. even when i'm with people. i have been manic for the past 6 months and it was beautiful (except for the intermittent psychosis ofc). but fuck i want to be psychotic.. it's certainly better than this. i've just taken an oxycodone, adderall.. drinking a beer.. i cut again night before last and i've even found my non dull razors.. i feel nothing and yet everything at the same time.. i feel so fucking dramatic right now but i figured if anyone could understand it would be other people like me. idk why i think being psychotic would be better than this but i guess it's because im confident. my hallucinations and delusions are real... i don;t feel real right now. i feel like a bag of bones (hence why i want to cut into it). idk what to fucking do but is anyone else struggling to keep their grip on reality.. but secretly just wants to fall head-first into it. i hate my illness, but the symptoms and coping skills (albeit harmful and self destructive) i've come to know and love over the years of having this illness, just seem so appealing and comforting to me rn. thanks for your time.

"kinda hate this (this is a lot of word vomit it, might not make sense) it feels fucking weird to feel empty sometimes. like i'm just listening to music for 30 minutes and i feel fucking nothing. i love listening to music a lot and it's been offering me an escape from the world, but this week has been hell. 

earlier this week my friend told me something and that was the first time my brain went silent for months. it felt weird, but after that, i feel no joy anymore. before that, it was hard to feel sometimes but it was there, but now it's rarely there in the first place. i do not want to be like this, i've just been slowly getting worst as time passed and i use to believe that it would simply get better, but it's like every other week some bullshit that ruins me is revealed and i've become practically numb to it. but ever since i finally cried for the first time in 6 months i can feel some of those negative emotions finally festering in the worst way possible right now.

"i luckily rarely feel bad depression, tonight is one of those times. this post is just to write it out of myself.i feel like i am in a battle with my own thoughts and emotions. right now i feel alone even though i have people who support me. i do not want to give in to depression, but i also do not have life goals, motivation or really anything that excites me. i do not have a bad life, but i do not have anything going on now (no job, no healthy hobbies, no meeting with people). i was not fully okay when i still attended school either which makes me worried/scared that this feeling will come back even when i will finally have a job that occupies my mind.i am stressed about having to juggle and fix so many things in my life at once: work, friendships, house chores, anxiety, depression, hobbies, habits, therapist... it is too much, and it feels like i am going nowhere. it feels like that even though i try to be better, get better, it works only for some time then all comes crashing down. as if it was a sign that my efforts are worthless.i really want this war in my head to end. even though anxiety and depression have been giving me a hell of a time in these past months, somehow i still have hope left. somehow i still do not want to give up. i feel like i am super strong but at the same time i feel weak. not always, just rarely. normally i ""only"" feel meh, like my default is a bit lower than the average, so i can still function properly but i do not have a drive, an ambition for anything. i do not want to be on autopilot or worse anymore, i am not sure how to change that though.(there is no need to write anything under this post, like i said it is just to clear my headspace a bit. but if you really want to comment, leave the negative energies out of it, i do not want to feel worse.) battling with myself",Depression,360

"my generic eye pain is totally an eye-eating parasite, right? woke up this morning around 4am to my eye burning like hell, my eye was pouring tears and super sensitive to light, my vision was blurred, and my eyelids felt like they were coated in glass.

i got pissed, thinking i maybe had pink eye. waited until 8am to go in to the doctor. by the time i did this, all that was left was a vague shred of soreness and light sensitivity- no more redness or crying. doctor couldn't figure out what was wrong.

cue my anxiety.

she put me on antibiotic eye drops, and told me to go to an ophthalmologist if it gets worse. 

fast forward to this evening. the burning is back. not as bad as before, but it's dull and present.

and now, i'm freaking out. hyperventilating, sobbing, posting to reddit. sounds dumb, i know. but i'm fucking terrified. my vision is everything to me and eye problems freak me out more than anything in the entire world. i keep thinking back to some stupid show i saw where someone contracted acanthamoeba and i'm running through the symptoms non-stop. this guy got it by wearing contacts in the shower? shit! i did that three times last week! his eye felt like a foreign object was in it! oh fuck! me too!

i know that the symptoms for just about every eye problem include ""red, itchy, burning"" but i'm so fixated on this worst case scenario i'm making myself sick.

i'll take a thousand nightmares of pregnancy scares and infections that'll kill me over this one. it honestly feels like my life is ending, ha.

anyway, i'm not claiming that i have this-- but i've mentally convinced myself that i do. anyone able to talk some sense into me?

"i feel like my psychologist might be ready to refer me elsewhere i have ocd with a health anxiety emphasis. my worries have run the gamut but i mostly focus on the idea of skin cancer. i have been seeing a psychologist for cbt and while in the sessions everything he says sounds logical and makes perfect sense. however, the second i encounter a mole i feel looks suspicious i don't apply what i've learned in therapy and i do everything wrong. i start by googling my symptoms and then when that doesn't work, i go to my doctor to seek reassurance. this assuages my fears temporarily but sometimes its not enough until the doctor will agree to a biopsy. then inevitably the cycle continues.

my psychologist has been doing this therapy with me for months and i was doing so well until i tried testing myself and found a new mole. i was definitely not ready for it and this started a downward spiral where i feel like all the progress i made went by the wayside and i was back to how i was in the beginning.

today i had a session after my most recent urgent care &amp; doctor visit. the tone was a lot different this time and i can tell he's frustrated with me because i am not using his advice. he kept saying, ""i am sorry that i haven't been able to get through to you to help you."" and has pointed out that i am not doing the work of not giving into my compulsions. he said that he didn't want to make me go through therapy if i wasn't motivated to do the work to get better. he's totally right. 


the positive that came out of this is that i am reflecting on my lack of motivation to do what i know i need to do to get better. i feel like i can prove myself to him from this point forward but i don't know that he's willing to continue treating me. hopefully this next appointment isn't him telling me its the last one. anyway, thank you for reading!",Anxiety,358

"sorry about the title, just wanted to grab attention i am slowly recovering from depression after so many years of suffering from it. i was in such a dark phase and since i was able to come out of it, i just want to say this to you all (to whoever suffering from a lot of things in life) : i may not understand what you are going through but there is definitely light in the end of the tunnel, provided you are willing to reach there by putting efforts. i believe we all need the push we require to excel what we are capable of in life. there is definitely hope, no matter what situation you are trapped in. i know when you are depressed, you tend to be way too hard on yourself. i have felt hopelessness for the longest time in life and eventually i got way too comfortable in feeling that way and failed to get out of the hell, which indeed ruined my life further. so, please start reflecting on yourself from a different perspective and you will definitely find a way to deal with any situation by nurturing yourself. talk to someone who would help you get out of whatever situation. yes, we all need validation and we seek to find people who would say comforting words and it is necessary but not every single time. sometimes, you need people who would push you to do your best by being honest with you. never start to pity yourself then you will eventually get too comfortable being that way and it will be very hard to get out of it. be compassionate with yourself by knowing how you could improve certian attributes to enhance your performance in life and start taking small steps. remember, to take only small steps in the beginning because since we are depressed, we may easily find the job overwhelming if we set difficult short term goals. trust me on this because i have been there and have ruined my life enough. there is always hope!!! start taking care of yourself!! exercising helps a lott!!!!!! i just want to she would some positivity on whoever reading this. sorry, if i came across as condescending anywhere across the paragraph. listen everybody!!",Depression,379

"i've been struggling but i think this is the last straw.. my mom died last oct, i've been fighting legal battles with my stepbrothers that dropped surprise court papers on me that basically said fuck you in mid dec. they were supposed to be filing an estate immediately but took their time until they conspired enough support and stolen everything they wanted. 

last month the legal battles were supposed to be over, they withdrew, they are not over...

just under a month ago i began the laborious task of moving 20+yrs of stuff with little to no help. the things the stepbrothers stole, like truck and trailer would of helped tremendously in moving and storage.

this last weekend i began swapping some of my mom's stuff out for mine and disposing of some of it. i moved half of it to the curb and kept back a working fridge and a couch.

then i got sick, i'm still sick.

garbage came tuesday and still sick i halfheartedly worked on my mess...as the local neighbor rookie gun-hobcop drop by...he seen me working... i seen him see me.

today i received a citation for non working appliances, ""it's a nuisance""...except they do work...well the fridge did. i ""removed"" the doors as the officer i called and spoke to advised. then i proceeded to fill my sidewalk with ever single bit of stuff i don't want.

this same cop started dating a girl down the street last year at some point who recently turned 18...

around this time my step dad died and mom had cancer, i was having financial troubles and gas was $5/gallon. i asked on local facebook pages trying to get a charger for my electric trimmer to no avail. eventually my grass was exactly the height max allowed..in spots...so naturally this same cop took it upon themselves to send me a citation. when complaining about the citation on a local page i was told ""if i can't afford to mow my grass i should pay someone to do it"".........like wtf...

"i cannot live with being ugly anymore. i know that soon in the future i will kill myself because i am so fkn ugly. being attractive is the only thing i want in life. if i cannot be that, i cannot be happy and follow my dreams. if i cannot be happy and follow my dreams, suicide is my only option. there is no reason to live a miserable life.i do not care when people say that everyone is perfect and pretty. no its bullshit. there is attractive people and there is unattractive people. and attractive people have it so much easier in life. i am currently 18 and ruined my life from 15-18. being ugly affects every decision i make in life. its the reason i am not social. its the reason i am always stressed. its the reason i have no future and live a miserable life. i do not know what to say. i just want to ve attractive and follow my dreams. but i cannot being this ugly. so suicide is my only option. being ugly will be my because of death",Depression,186
