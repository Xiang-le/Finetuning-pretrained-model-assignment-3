up until last year i was an extremely sedentary 28yo weighing around 265 lbs. i started a new job that is fairly physical and since then i have dropped down to 230ish. well last week i was laying down and felt something i never felt before in my chest. i went to the doctor and he said it was almost certainly my xiphoid process. i also mentioned i had a general cough (i us an e-cigarette), as well as a periodical tingle under my right shoulder-blade. other than those three things i felt completely normal.

my doctor said everything felt normal, my blood pressure was normal, as was my pulse and he checked me out with a stethoscope. in the end he ordered an x-ray to be certain. from that appointment up until i got my results i started stressing out (tight chest, sweating, vomiting, trouble sleeping, just overall freaking out about what that x-ray might show). low and behold i got my result and everything came back looking completely normal. although that is great news i haven't been able to ditch the tight chest, trouble sleeping with bad thoughts, and general feeling of just being uncomfortable. i also wear a fitbit to work and constantly find myself checking my heart rate (between 59 when i sleep and 120ish when i'm up working).

"a whole slew of problems... normal? i've been dealing with anxiety since september, specifically generalized anxiety disorder (gad). since then i've had a few recurring symptoms that my first doctor had waved off to anxiety, but since then have gotten more common. i will be talking to a new doctor soon since i need to get back on meds after my last attempt ended, so i will be talking to them about this, but wanted others' opinions/experiences too, for comfort especially.

i had a huge fear of contracting rabies since i work with animals. i know this is not logical, since any animal that has ever scratched me (i've never been bit) has not had rabies, and since even though i exhibited some general symptoms that happened to line up with rabies, i've been this way since september. so, i'd be dead by now. 

some of those symptoms are, like i said, pretty general and line up with anxiety-related symptoms. minor muscle twitching, ""foggy"" thinking, being irritable, trouble swallowing/dry mouth (has never impaired eating/drinking), etc. i also have had a totally random symptom from those, which is sharp, short-lived pains in my chest, and now they're along my lower abdomen and uterus. 

my new doctor has seen me once for chest pains when they wouldn't stop one day. she said everything sounded fine as far as my heart and lungs, i wasn't experiencing limited breathing, and the pain wasn't long-lived and was sharp, not like a pressure or anything. she was hoping it was from acid reflux, which i was having issues with, but after a month of medicine for that, i'm still having that.

i need some advice my boyfriend has bipolar 2. lately i've been noticing that his episodes of depression have been getting progressively worse. he's been missing work and sleeping most of the day away lately. i tried to encourage him to go to work this morning. i even told him to take it one step at a time and i would be there encouraging him throughout. he immediately said no. i tried telling him the same thing but with a different approach and he still said no. he started to get aggravated with me so i backed off. i've noticed that he's been getting slightly aggravated with me lately when i try to be encouraging so i'll back off and let him do his own thing once i detect it. the only reason why i try to encourage him so much is because i'm so used to doing it whenever i'm dealing with my own depression. i love him so much but i don't know how to fully get through to him without seeming to aggravated him. can someone please give me some advice on what to do. thank you in advance,Bipolar,192

with psychiatrist we've been going through my possible hypomanias but specially been  focused on one which was the most severe one. during this period i broke up with my boyfriend (do not regret it), had  a huge crush before breakup, slept with the person i had a crush few days after breaking up, felt really happy and energetic, got involved in politics, slept 5h a night (usually 8+h), got in an out of situationships, went to parties, told everybody how beautiful i am (usually i'm not happy with my body). my psychiatrist didn't ask on my drug use but i've realized that before this episode or in the beginning of this episode i took some psychedelics. i really don't want drug use on my medical records since i've been sober for a year now. does anybody else have any feelings on drug use on their medical records?

if i tell my psychiatrist i have taken illegal drugs before the episode i might not get the diagnosis. but then again i suffer from mood swings and cyclic severe depressions. i don't know anymore what is my normal state and if i exaggerate my possibly hypomanic symptoms. i've had other hypomanic episodes as well. in one i had for few weeks i moved in with a guy for a month who i'd known for two days, didn't fly back to home even though covid-19 restrictions were starting, posted dancing videos on instagram, said i love you to the person i was living with, had unprotected sex. but again this person was very manipulative and was gaslighting me, love bombing, and getting mad for me moving out. i feel like my psychiatrist could very easily misdiagnose me since my hypomanias might be caused some other things such as drugs or manipulation. how do you feel, is hypomania something that can't be caused by other factors in your life?

whole my life, i have been doing impulsive decisions like gotten three tattoos at once (my first ones), brought flight tickets for next day, traveled by myself, applied to new schools, cheated, went to strip club (not normal to me), had hookups. on all of these i've had regrets as well. i don't know what is my personality and what not. if i tell my psychiatrist that these actions were not normal to me then i probably get the diagnosis. but also i do these things so regularly that maybe those are charasterictic to me.",Bipolar,477

so, i've been stable for about 6 months now doing what i'm doing and actually being successful (how i perceive it anyways). i'm holding a job, i'm loved by my peers and getting along with my parents better than ever. i've matured a lot i guess, but being disciplined with my diet, meds, and sleep, have made it all stay together.

just a couple weeks back my mom got diagnosed with breast cancer... and i'm pretty sure the restaurant i'm working at is going to close soon because i've never seen a shit show like this ever! everyone is drunk and indifferent... it's sad.  aaaaaaand now my ex wants to talk on the phone today (only have let her text me recently since making amends and healing our friendship). she's been sporadically contacting me telling me this or that reminded her of me... i really feel like she eventually (prolly not today) wants to try and rekindle things. she's expressed since finalizing our divorce how she feels she messed up and turned her back on me when i was simply severely depressed. i get that now and i understand why she did what she did, and he don't blame her for it one bit. but i can't trust her anymore like that. she'll prolly drop me when i hit another dip in my journey. 

i'm overloaded right now. but i'm staying disciplined and trying to do everything how i need to, to stay stable. it's working i guess, but man, this is the shitty part of life that usually puts me down for a year. i'm afraid, but i'm excited to challenge my will through these tough times.

 oh yeah, i forgot in my rambling, my parents (whom i'm living with currently) are selling their house and moving to a different city. overall a good thing for all of us, but keeping the house clean and sprucing it up for random showings today with a few hours notice is stressful.

a few days ago we were playing an online game together as we often do and after a while they mentioned that they were also talking to another friend while playing and i realized that was why they were so quiet compared to all the other times. i started shutting down after that but kept playing together for a few hours. we didn't say anything but i knew they were talking to the other friend instead. they did say bye when they were getting off and for the first time i didn't say anything back. still haven't said anything and feel bad cause we are the best friends each other has ever had and i know for sure it is true for them, they are not lying. but just can't help these feelings of not wanting to talk to them anymore and pushing them away. i feel so ridiculous for feeling like this like for them it's just a normal interaction with someone else and not knowing how bad it made me feel.",Personality disorder,283

advice hey everybody you may have seen me post on here a lot recently and i do apologise for that i don't want to waste anyone's time. however since november when i'm stupidly ingested cannabis one night and ended up in hospital because my heart went to fast my anxiety has got so much worse. that night in hospital i was convinced i was gonna have a heart attack and die i was in so much pain and agony and in the ambulance the paramedics said my heart was going to fast but this was down to anxiety and nothing wrong with my heart. same in the hospital they tried to treat my heart with medication but they couldn't slow it down they said this was because it was not an irregular heart it was normal just a bit fast once again due to anxiety so i was left over night and discharged the next day. december 4th i dislocated my knee for the 2nd time and while waiting to be seen in hospital my heart went to fast so they put me in a ward over night and did all the tests bloody tests for my heart and ecgs nothing once again and anxiety once again. then after that is when my intrusive thoughts started and that went on for a few weeks i still get it on and off now however. but the last 2-3 days my heart has been going fast i'm losing my breath easily and i can feel my heart palpitating i've had countless doctors and tests look at me and nothing to do with my heart? i've even rang a hotline about this and they said anxiety does all this it seems to go in a cycle my thoughts then everything is okay for a while then my heart and thoughts again can anyone help?,Anxiety,311

"convinced i have mri contrast dye poisoning weeks after a brain mri. need help coping. using a somewhat new throwaway account, sorry if my karma is low. i'm sort of new to the realization that i have ha, but it all makes sense now. i've always had anxiety, but it's definitely evolved into this about 6 months ago.

a few months back, i had some strange symptoms that were related to jaw pain. i've pretty much figured out what's wrong there, but because of that, i've seen a slew of doctors including a neurologist. my doctor ordered a brain mri with contrast just to be safe. i stupidly googled if the contrast dye can cause adverse reactions in people (i strongly suggest you don't google it.) anyway, after the mri, i felt nauseated, which set my ha into a tailspin. 

now, a few weeks later, i'm noticing that my feet, hands, and legs suddenly go cold, especially when i'm sitting down. i'm talking freezing cold, even if the rest of my body is warm. when they finally warm up, i get pins and needles all down my legs and today, i woke up with muscle spasms in my feet and legs. my scumbag brain is telling me i have some type of weird contrast dye poisoning that isn't curable, you know how it goes.

my feet getting freezing cold does happen when i'm not in what i would say would be a heightened state of anxiety. it usually sends me into a state of anxiety which i'm sure definitely doesn't help my extremities. it's a real chicken/egg scenario.

does this sound like anxiety to anyone or should i actually be concerned? i mean, i'm young (just turned 30,) i exercise about 4 or 5 times a week, i eat pretty healthy, and am all around healthy. in my mind, this should not be happening, but, here i am. i'm also worried that if i go to the doctor and ask him to test to see if i still have the dye in my system, he's going to think i'm crying wolf and won't take me seriously when something else is wrong.

"having a bit of a health scare right now, could use some help making sure this doesn't spiral out of control. hi everyone, new here, but could use some help.

i am a 27 year old male.  i have a history of health anxiety/hypochondria and i also have an undiagnosed chronic inflammatory pain condition.  i also have gerd and barrett's esophagus.

i stopped taking the prilosec i was taking for my gerd and also haven't been to a doctor in about 4 or 5 years to get an endoscopy.  for those of you who don't know barrett's esophagus is a precancerous condition.   this is also where the concern comes in.

i drink pretty heavily, not everyday, but definitely on weekends, and i also smoke socially.

leading up to new year's i started noticing that i could feel liquids going down into my stomach a little more than usual.  this was a little alarming, then my gerd started getting worse.  then i started having problems swallowing and then i completely lost my appetite.  i've been struggling with appetite loss and swallowing problems for a couple weeks now.

now when you google the symptoms these are all common symptoms of esophageal cancer.  this is where the fun has begun.  i don't know where the cycle started, but i am thoroughly convinced i have cancer at this point.  

i've made a doctor's appointment to my primary, and asked for a referral to a gastroenterologist.   gastroenterologist office says they are ""reviewing my file"" so i can't make an appointment yet. this concerns me, dont want to jump through hoops because part of my file is missing. 

in the meantime, i'm just trying to get through the days.  super hungry, but zero appetite so i've been forcing myself to eat which is awful.   but i also feel like i've been worrying myself to death thinking it's cancer and spending time on my phone ""researching"".  

what can i do?  tonight i was going to take a xanax, turn my phone off and watch a movie to try and calm myself down, but i didn't end up doing that.  i just ended up looking at more esophageal cancer stuff.  

how do i stop worrying about this until i get my doctor appointments.  it might be a month or two at this rate before i get an endoscopy!  ",Anxiety,390

"asked my parents (who i don't live with) for an extra 10 or so a week spending money and they've turned it into a big thing i am currently under an intense care plan as an outpatient at a mental health hospital. one of the nurses suggested asking for an extra amount of allowance. 'well off' (but not rich) parents completely fund me while i'm at university as my loan is less than my rent.

i was debating asking for weeks, me and my parents have had a strained relationship in the past to say the least, some definitely their fault, some a mix of both of our faults. anyway, it's left a gap between us that i haven't been brave enough to cross.

but last night i asked them, told them i wasn't struggling with the current allowance it would purely be for an extra nice thing a week to help me get by during these times. imo they've blown it way out of proportion, they wanted a phone call today to log all my spending and now they're wanting to come and visit me today. it's sending my anxiety haywire this is why i don't open up or ask anything from my parents.

what do i do? say no to them visiting all together? i'm 100% fine with keeping the current allowance, i just want a yes or a no to have some closure on this conversation with my parents.

"advice on long-term treatment for a bipolar depressed family member? my brother has had bipolar depression since he was a teenager, he's mid-20s now and still living with our retired father. recently, he ""attempted suicide"" by jumping off a 15-foot balcony and breaking his feet, leading to hospitalization (and inpatient psych). given the background context below, what would you do?

* he has talked about and threatened suicide hundreds of times

* this is the third time he's been hospitalized in the last 90 days (previously for psychosis and suicidal threats)

* each time, he's released after 3-5 days after he begins to act normal and wants to go home

* our father is a psychiatrist who desperately wants to help him, and has not been willing to ""kick him out"" of the house

* he has not been willing to consider longer-term inpatient psychiatric options (i don't know what options are available?) and because he always has had my father's home to return to, the hospital is always able to discharge him

* he has seen at least 20 psychiatrists in the last decade, and taken hundreds of different medications, with zero success

* he has received a year of ect treatment, with significant memory loss and only temporary depression relief

* he dropped out of high school due to a combination of social phobia, depression, sensory issues, and rage issues

* he has never applied for a job

first off ive dealt with it my entire life since i wa ab 9 yr old im very familiar with the feeling of anxiety and i ve experienced it in alot of form i wa in a relationship for year where i experienced the absolute worst of it but i am not in that relationship anymore i am a full time student again and im living life on my own accord now with my whole life ahead of me and i can do anything i want now im so glad to be where im at and i cant wait for what the future hold i have no worry in the world anymore anyways here i am watching better call saul relaxing in my bed super comfortable in my mushroom blanket that i love so much and i just gradually out of nowhere start to feel my chest get tight tight to the point where i want to poke a hole in my chest just to relieve the pressure obviously im not gon na do that but you get the idea im not panicking about anything while this is happening i mean when i feel my chest tighten then im like okay wtf is going on but before that nothing im a relaxed a can be ready to go to sleep to wake up to next day ahead of me and so i do some breathing exercise to try to relieve this chest tightness and i do feel really relaxed from doing them but that chest tightness is still there and again im not panicking of anything like i would from my traditional anxiety attack is this a new form of anxiety where my body is just like you know what youre trying to go to sleep so im gon na make it hard to breathe for no reason bc you are finally happy in life with no worry so ill give you something to worry ab i read ab people having panic attack out of nowhere and sometimes fainting even but that ha never happened to me my anxiety attack always stemmed from something regardless of how silly or insignificant it wa the anxiety would always come from something like it wouldn t just spontaneously erupt into an attack so is this just a new form of anxiety im dealing with right now is there anything i can do breathing and relaxing exercise only make me calm mentally and really relax me but the uncomfortableness of my chest just being tight is preventing me from going to sleep so i dont really know what to do if this is in fact just anxiety what do you all think is this just an anxiety attack or are there other issue i should get checked out any response is appreciated tl dr random chest tightness wont go away even with a calm and relaxed state of mind wondering if this is anxiety just attacking my body,Depression,494

the biggest irony of the lamo experience is that i suspect if i were to keep taking it, i could have found a way to live with the hair situation. i cannot afford a good wig. i make 16.00 an hour. i have no self esteem to draw upon in this regard, so my np okayed me to drop it and start trileptal, which she said might work for me like lamo seemed to.

the first guy ""dave"" i met when i was 19 on vacation. he and i would just talk at the pool about politics and education (even though he was kind of a party guy, he has a nerdy side). we only hung out for two days, but after our first day hanging out, the second day, he was really shy talking to me. but our romance was cut short because he had a girlfriend, and made the mistake of spilling the beans about his crush on me to other kids at the resort. he cut off contact with me, but when they broke up a month later, he started looking at my social media a lot. not to mention, he made a playlist about me for my birthday. we don't even talk, so i don't know if this is some sort of peace offering or apology. 

the second guy ""steve"" i met a year later, at my job. he and i bonded on the first day of work about growing up in the same hometown, and i told my mom that day about how we bonded over our ""parallel lives"". we worked together for a little over a year. and we never went out or anything, but he would hit on me a lot. but stupid me was either too dense to realize he was flirting or too surprised in the moment to say any good flirting lines back. but a customer asked me for my number one day, and i gave it to him. i guess i kind of wanted to motivate my crush to ask me out, but literally the week after, he went out with his sister's friend (the sister set them up), but they broke up and he likes me.

i have noticed no changes yet, but he told me that it could take a while before anything really changes. all i've noticed is how paranoid i've been that they are giving me a placebo. i want to get the pills they gave me and open up the capsule just to see if there's anything in there, but if there is then is it medicine or sugar? maybe it's just some sort of powder that doesn't actually do anything. 

what if they are giving me fake medicine? are they trying to see if i can change just by believing some miracle pill will do something? it feels like they're trying to disprove my avpd even though they were the ones to diagnose me.

 i have a crush on a girl. my brother is friend's with her brother. my brother and her are also friends and seem to talk often. 

she had a crush on and liked my brother at some point, maybe she still does, i have no idea. 

sadly, we never really talk or anything, especially outside of social gatherings where the whole ""group"" is already hanging out. i spoke directly to her, and vice versa a handful of times yesterday while we were all hanging out. 

it was kind of me just speaking for the sake of speaking, i didn't go out of my way to do it too much though because i was very anxious, nervous, and insecure around her.

anyway, we've never interacted on social media, and she hasn't followed me or anything even though she probably knows that i have some social media accounts, for example, on twitter she has most likely seen me reply to my brother's tweets.

am i just being childish and over-analyzing social media?

"anxiety med. that's not an antidepressant? hello! 

i have always been anxious, and as of 2-3 years ago, i was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. i've been in therapy for years and tried all sorts of medications (lexapro, zoloft, medical marijuana, cbd, valium, klonopin, xanax, amitriptyline), and the only thing that worked were the benzos. i'm extremely lucky to have an np who fills my xanax refills. the problem is... i don't want to be addicted to this medication. i take it very sparingly, which is why it works so well, but i only take these when i feel nauseous/jittery/panicky, which, fortunately, is not 24/7. however, i do have gad pretty bad. in the shower, thoughts just race and i can't find the ""off"" switch. it's ruined my sleep. it's taken a dump on my memory. i just cannot live like this anymore. 

meditations help in the moment i do them, but i feel like i need to be medicated. i was on zoloft for about 6 months, and it helped tremendously, but when i tried getting back on it (i properly titrated my dose when i get off them), for some reason the side effects were extremely unbearable. granted, i started back at 50mg, when before i was on it for 25mg for a week and then 50mg the second week and continued for 4-6 weeks. it could also be that at the time i could tolerate medical marijuana, but now, that makes me either anxious/jittery or straight-up nauseous. 

lexapro? forget it. i started at 10mg, and that was a nightmare. i was so nauseous by day 2, if it wasn't for my anti-nausea med, i would've projectile vomitted all over my kitchen floor. the other time i was at 5mg, and i felt so cracked out. 

i also don't like that ssris are rough on my body for 4-6 weeks. maybe that's just the gamble you take, but i hate having increased anxiety, inability to ejaculate, and horrendous stomach pains for a month. does that sound like fun to anyone? 

i took amitriptyline, and that was more for chronic pain, and it barely did anything, and as for anxiety, i didn't notice much of a difference either, and i tried this medication at 10 and 25mg.

i have an appointment with my np tomorrow, and she is well aware i struggle with anxiety. is there a medication that's not an antidepressant that works for gad and is not a benzo, meaning i can take as often as needed? 

i've also tried supplements like l-theanine, melatonin, and ashwagandha, and they don't do crap.

"i have attempted suicide 14-ish times in the past and obviously i am not very good at dying. lately i have been feeling so alone and overwhelmed. nothing feels real again. everything is just fake. i am watching a movie of myself. for the first time in years i am feeling the ""static"" i felt as a kid again. the static of my brain, filtering everything and just not letting me feel joy or experience stuff in the moment. i recall my day but i do not *remember* it if that makes sense. a low-key and fucked up part of me misses being in an icu bed and dying. it is awful i know, but when i was in the icu at least someone cares about me and at least someone paid attention to me. i do not have a family or very many friends and i just want some fucking care and i want to be held. when i was in the icu last time i had nurses constantly check on me and ppl come talk to me. a part of me lives in a hospital, because that is all i have really known. do i want to kill myself? or do i miss being cared about? if i attempt suicide and it fails, than i go to the icu or hospital. if i attempt suicide and succeed, than i get the added bonus if dying i suppose. i have 3 different methods i could use and it is crazy how easy they are. and how accessable they are. i am obviously not going to share them but 1 will be painless while the other two may because ouchies. i do not really care though because once i am dead, i am dead. who cares if it hurt lmfao.all i need to do is walk across my room. i am tired and numb and just need change or an escape. i am so fucking lonely and just want a friend that i will not burden or i will not be afraid of rejection. i want more friends that also are not white so i do not have to put up with racist shit and accept it as a fucked up norm. i want friends who understand how fucking awful racism feels and how much it affects you down to your core. i want connection, i want love, i need attention and care. but i do not have any way if getting that and i feel so alone and depressed. i do not know if it is that i want to actively kill myself or i just need something to change. maybe a bit of both. i am feeling too many emotions but also struggling with an empty, drowning depression. i am on the verge of suicide.",Suicidal,467

"doctor wants medication changes there's  a long history with my psychiatric illnesses and medications but i'll jump ahead. 2 and a half years ago i got extreme ppd and was hospitalized twice. i was only on a small bit of klonopin at first but it stopped working. everything i tried made me crazier until one doctor put me on celexa. after initial anxiety it changed my life. saw a regular psych who tried different things so i wouldn't get manic and i was hesitant. had a huge drunken manic episode, was hospitalized again and prescribed abilify 10 and it helped a lot. that was almost a year ago.

&amp;#x200b;

i was doing okay, taking sleeping pills at night, stomach meds, ativan, propanolol. i needed birth control for pmdd

recently psych took me off sleeping pills and ended propanolol (i get severe anxiety an panic attacks). my birth control made my anxiety unbearable one week every month so my med doc switched me to something else and increased my stomach meds (acid reflux/gastritis. 

i started an anti inflammatory diet being tired of this mess and was exercising doing well and happy, which my psych thought was hypomania, although i was still depressed a lot. she wanted me to drop my dosage to 10 mg while remaining on 10mg abilify. i am terribly med sensitive and many things cause crazy reactions for a long time. that is a big cut for me. 

so basically in one month, new birth control (also sensitive), no sleep meds, less anti anxiety meds, more stomach problems and now a decrease in a med that i had no problem with. i'm two days in and already going crazy, what can i expect?

&amp;#x200b;

long story short, lots of med changes. on abilify 10mg, ativan twice a day, loe estrin fe, and dropping 20 mg citalopram to 10 and feel a mess.",Bipolar,314

on top of that, suddenly today i've been getting tingling and numbness on my left arm and hand/fingers.

i was streaming a game and i noticed my left hand started shaking and twitching, and my right is perfectly fine. so after ending my stream, i went into the bathroom to check it more and it's been really scaring because my brain thinks i'm having a stroke...

"medication adjustments, i'm frustrated . 22/f, bipolar 2. i need a rant . i'm in college. i struggled with schooling my entire life, i guess for the simple fact that things don't hold my attention or interests for long. pair that with depression and random hypomania, anxiety and well... nothing good. i dropped out of hignschool but got my vrade 12 and now i'm trying to better myself . while i'm doing better than before due to medication, it's still a struggle. 
back in february  2017, i made the hard choice to see my doctor and have a referal put in to see a psychiatrist . since i live in a shitty area, we have one fly in once every so often. so when i seen him, he put me on lamotragine and said that was the issue at hand to be dealt with first, then we would see what the next point of action would be (adhd, depression, anxiety). since i've been doing well with anxiety, he suspected adhd would be next and seemed to think i would be able to notice after the dose was increased a few times. 
 fast forward to today. i'm on 150mg of lamotragine, clonazepam as needed (when i get aggressive, panic attacks etc). i was leveled out for months at 125mgs, but had a checkup for refills back in october where my family doctor increased them because the psychiatrist wanted to see about getting me up to 300mgs. since it was what the psychiatrist wanted, family doctor wanted to keep increasing to ""see what the differance is""... i was hesitant because i'm in school, i don't want to jeopardize anything, and this dosage i was on was tried and true as far as i was concerned. after telling him how i felt he said ""your feeling good now, maybe you could be feeling better"" so... benefit of the doubt, i did as i was told. 
yesterday i had another appointment. i went in, figuring it was the usual routine. told him i couldn't concentrate, i was feeling distracted often and easily, and my interests were shifting pretty often so i was concerned. i asked to see the psychiatrist again to talk about adhd since that's what was suggested before, and seems to be what i'm dealing with. i was told we dont have one right now.... but would very soon and i would have a referral put in  to see him/her for when we do and they visit. awesome, right? 
so now he wants to lower my dosage back to 125mgs to ""see the difference"" which is the same shit i was told when he increased it to 150mgs. i don't want to do that. i'm uncomfortable, possibly distressed about the thought of it altogether since i'm so sensitive to these things. i can't afford a hypomanic/depressive spiral right now, not while i'm in school... so i'm thinking i'll just keep my dosage until i see another psychiatrist....  fml",Bipolar,496

"since i was a small child i have always hated myself, the way i look, the way i talk and most importantly, the way i am. i have come to terms with the way that i look over the years but as a person i am still disgusting.i am used to a lil sadness but these two years have been brutal, and i feel i am getting worse.last year i had an eating disorder (its been on an off since i was 12, i am 22 btw) n that was my only motivation day to day, to see how much i can lose. now i do not even have that.i have a partner that loves me (at least that is what they say) but i see no point in my existence, i do not want them to deal with my problems, i try to be the best girlfriend i can but i feel like a burden, no one wants to be around someone so gloomy all the time.i want to die but i feel that would be selfish to the people that know me and for the poor bastard that has to find my dead body. even thought, everybody that knows me, knows how miserable i am, so it would come to no surprise. (they do not really say anything about it, but what would they say ? i have always been like this.)

"being a ghost would be my ideal form of existence. i really enjoy watching people live their lives, listening indirectly to their conversations while in public, being an observer of events etc. my problem is having to interfere on the world, i hate having to talk and to do things that will have consequences in it. i wish i could just watch life like a tv show or as if i was a ghost, in a way that no one could see me, nothing would be expected of me and i wouldn't need to worry because i would be certain of it. i could just contemplate the world in peace.

some of you guys may have watched euphoria and i definitely feel a connection with the description made about lexi, how she felt like she was an just observer and that her life was not really her life, just some sort of play or movie.

these days i been having the classic ""i want to leave all behind and live in the woods with just a dog"" idea and daydreams, and i guess that a big part of it is because i feel like there i could be like this, or at least similar enough. be an observer of nature, never having to deal with socialization again, only brief interactions for, let's say, buy necessary stuff from other people (which i don't mind). i know this isn't realistic for my context and also that it probably wouldn't be this magical thing, but it's a fantasy that brings me satisfaction.

i guess i'm just burned out of people. a lot of bad things happened in my relational and social life since childhood till last year and i'm really bitter about it right now. of course i want to find real connection, where i could be myself openly and comfortably, but because it always goes wrong and brings disappointments i'm really hopeless at this point and honestly kinda angry. i don't have patience for people anymore, i'm tired, i'm being judgy as hell and i'm activelly avoiding new people.",Personality disorder,347

"symptoms for bipolar disorder? hello all,
i'm 18 years old and i'm new to reddit. when i was ten years old, i began to have depression. it wasn't severe, but i would often isolate myself from others and think about dying. over time, my depression has gotten worse. however, at age 12 i began to have severe mood swings. sometimes i would get very angry at everybody and everything around me for no reason. sometimes it would last for a few days, and then i would go back to feeling ""stable"" or depressed. at age 15, i began to have three distinct and intense emotions that have taken over my life until this point. i rarely felt stable at that point. this feeling can occur for a week or less, i feel veryyyyyyy euphoric. i actually love life and everything around me. i feel very energetic and hyper like a five year old. i'm bouncing off the walls, and talk very fast because my thoughts race. sometimes i can't sleep at night because my thoughts would never shut up. however, i have never done anything impulsive. i'm mostly abnormally energetic and euphoric. then, i can switch to a depressive episode. these are always the longest, they can last for 4-6 months. at that moment, i'm extremely suicidal. i've never tried to commit suicide because i'm scared of failing but the craving is always there. i'm also hopeless, think that everybody hates me, and i feel so dead and emotionally tired. i sleep for 8-9 hours and i still feel tired. i can have a good day and still feel extremely miserable even though i know i shouldn't. then, after my depressive episode, i can feel super angry and annoyed at everything and everybody for no reason. i just get super angry and lash out at anybody, and i don't know why. this lasts for a week or less. i have been to 4 therapists and none of them have really helped; i can't really afford one right now. my family aren't very supportive, it's taboo to talk about mental illness so they ignore my symptoms or brush them off as hormones since i'm a female. could i be bipolar? is it just hormones? your insight would be nice, i hope to a doctor soon to get a proper diagnosis but your insight will be helpful.

the symptoms have gotten better over the last week now while i had vacation and only swallowing large portions causes the pain or when there is a lot of sauce on it. but that is a state i reached a few weeks back and it eventually retuned.

this med change was somewhat needed. i have been hallucinating *a lot*. i hear voices, see things that aren't there, etc. i've also been so paranoid to the point i dont leave my house much other than work and back. i refuse to go to a store, and i refuse to go out anywhere in public where there's people because i'm convinced they are going to kill me. *sigh*. anyways, its gotten pretty bad so she's started me on risperdone (a.k.a risperdal) and something to help me sleep, restoril (temazepam).

i know this is just whining, but to be honest, i just don't want to have bipolar disorder. i've realized how serious bipolar disorder is and i don't want to deal with the stigma and the risks/uncertainty and the work involved. i don't want to keep having to disclose this loved ones. i don't want the decreased lifespan from being likely to commit suicide. i don't want the reckless decisions that come with mania and mixed states. i don't want any of this.

has anyone else experienced these feelings? how do i accept my condition so i can move on with my life?",Bipolar,228

it's not only happiness, that makes me laugh so much, even though i'm doing really well, generally speaking.

i have to admit to myself, that i'm hypomanic. i've been riding the high for a couple of days, getting things done, but it has to stop now, before it gets worse.

i've started dating this guy, that i've wanted to date for years.
he knows i'm bipolar, he just doesn't know what bipolar is, just yet. -or how it affects me. -and my surroundings. 
we were on the phone last night, and i was... not in control. at all. 
he was so confused, and i don't blame him.

"i am a 24 yo male. all throughout my life, i feel like i ""peaked"" really early on, and either through self-induced calamity, circumstance, or a combo of both came crashing down. even though i have not lived a long time, i already experienced a long term relationship, sex, life abroad, college, and some recognition. i realize how lucky i had been for to actually tick off those moments. but my relationship ended because i became self-grandiose and deemed myself ""settling"" for someone below me, whatever the hell that meant at the time. my life abroad ended because i forgot or was too nonchalant to file in some paperwork crucial to my legal standing. i have realized my ba and ms degrees, even though acquired from top universities, do not mean shit, when there were apparently thousands of software programs that i should have been mastering instead of wasting my time passing a ""introduction to beer"" ge course in college. i remember i used to be extremely motivated and driven up until three, four years ago. i always deemed it my best quality, that i could find the motivation from within. but ever since those times, i have just kept falling further and further away from what a subjective optimal human life from should be. i find it hard to be motivated to do most everyday tasks. i have grown a dislike for people. i think i have finally realized the superficiality of modern society, or at least the segment that i know. and everything seems extremely pointless. i have not had a job since grad school, and have not had a relationship after my said breakup. i might just have grown lazy. or i might be severely depressed. now lucky for the leech that i am, my expenses are, and will be for some time i think, paid for. and if i do not make some stupid mistakes, like getting married or adopting a baby or starting a business, or in any way do not add anyone or anything to the payroll, i could retire to a small bungalow in the country and meagerly live out the rest of my life without working or engaging with the society. i might grow into an alcoholic with a severed lung, but that is a bet i am going to have to make. i am not posing a question here. i am just writing down what i have been seriously thinking about for the past couple of months, and i want to know your opinion on it. i think there is no way out vertically, so i am thinking to change position horizontally, before ultimately falling off the radar. idk if any of these make sense to you folks. i am just very tired and bored and hopeless of life. thinking of retirement",Depression,471

(he works late or stays up late every night and i normally go to bed at a normal hour). i rushed out of the bedroom to him crumbled on the floor passed out. he actually damaged the wall some with going down and now has a gash in his shoulder. he came to pretty fast but was overall super pale shaking nauseous etc. he would not let me take him to the hospital or is not letting me call his doctor today. i am not sure what caused this but i started tallying his calorie intake and he is getting around 1000 calories a day at most and when he does eat it is normally complete shit (soda chips and cookies fast food etc). he is over 6 foot and in his mid 30s. he now has high blood pressure and high cholesterol along with other health issues. i am now super worried and he still has not eaten since he passed out. i just would like some help on what to do now as now i am almost worrying of i am dealing with some sort of male anorexia and not just depression. i wrote him something last night telling him that not even eating a child's portion of food everyday nor taking regular showers is unacceptable. i do not know if something like this is ok for someone with depression or whatever is going on though. just asking for tips to help my husband",Depression,459

i feel like i just don't wanna have to ask him to clean anymore. why can't he just do it on his own? i don't think i'm asking for a lot and i'm made to feel like a bitch or like i'm lecturing him when i'm all i'm doing is asking me to do some chores. in fact, why do i even have to ask? i feel hopeless. i feel stuck. i can't afford a housekeeper every week right now.

some brief background info:
i have autism so i may not always understand all social cues. neither my friend nor i live in the us.

i have a friend going through a hard time right now. he has depression and recently has been experiencing all sorts of physcial issues. he's had depression before i even met him and have never seen him this low. he also has money problems and thus can't afford treatment for his physical issues atm. 

what's the best way to support him?
i cannot support him financially since i also have almost no money.
 whenever i talk to him he gives short and/or snappy answers and is generally in a bad mood. whenever i talk about positive things, it feels preachy or that i'm ""rubbing happiness in his face"". whenever i try to talk about neutral things  (basically small talk) the conversation dies off. so he's understandably a bit difficult to talk to as of late.

"anxiety after the gym ever since i started going to the gym , i have fallen in love with it. i look forward to it everyday as it completely distracts me from whatever it is i might be dealing with in my head. i usually go in the evening and up until then i'm fine. but i swear that drive back from the gym and when i'm sitting in my room all alone, can be extremely excruciating sometimes. the anxiety feels like a balloon going up and up into the sky, eventually it will pop and come back down. it's just an awful feeling, and i feel it almost every time now. i wonder if anyone else has felt it or knows what i'm talking about? it's such a terribly lonely feeling i get. i think what really bothers me more than anything in my life is this belief i have that i am not a good person. i mean it's not like i'm cussing people out or being a dick to anyone. it's more like i treat people like they don't matter or mean anything to me, it's an extremely shitty thing to do. like i see a lot of the same people every day, and i think normally this would result in you forming a bond with them slowly at least. but it's not like that, everyone that's not in my immediate family just gets kept at arm's length. even then, the relationships i do have with my family almost seem to be held up by plastic and tape.",Personality disorder,261

"i'm coming out of a hypomanic episode and need to talk about it. i've been hypomanic for the last 3 weeks. i'm medicated and i'm teetotal etc so it was relatively minor. but fuck me does the depression hit me like a ton of bricks. it's more physical than mental at first. my limbs get heavy. i have zero energy to get up and do simple things. i procrastinate. skip a few meals. not brush my teeth. leave a chore that needs doing. then in a few days i'll feel all the mental affects coming in. if i'm lucky i'll just be comatose for a month. but if a mixed state comes along then it's panic attacks, anxiety, despair and suicidal ideation. fingers crossed it's just depression.

the hypomania was alright this time around. i have spent a bit too much, worked a bit too hard, overshared a bit too much, socialised a bit too much. but no real damage this time. it was intense but kind of pleasant. but i can feel the dip is going to be huge. this is anecdotal but it feels like if my mania is under control (no psychosis and no mixed state) the depression part is deeper. feel kind of quietly melancholic on an epic scale. if that makes any sense.

it's going to be a slog for the next month. i should be happy i've got things under control i suppose. anyone else want to share their experiences coming out of mania? it would make me feel better to hear others going through and surviving similar.",Bipolar,264

for the past 2.5 years i've had a swollen lymph node ~1cm on the side of my neck, and lower on my neck i can feel multiple squishy, tinier lymph nodes. i've had ultrasounds many times, and even a biopsy for a swollen node in my groin that came back negative for anything strange. today i found a swelling in my armpit and now i'm in crisis mode once again.

every day with this feels like a battle; i must constantly convince myself that i'm healthy when deep down, part of me believes i'm not. every time i think i've made progress it all comes rushing back in like the tide and i'm completely derailed again. i'm so fed up with this and it's clearly no way to live. i never think about the future at all because i can't picture lasting long enough to have a future.

i know this is kind of a rambling wall of text, i just needed to get this out somewhere because everyone i talk to in my personal life just tells me what to do to feel better. to change my thoughts, to eat healthier, to be more active, yet when these thoughts occur it's like i'm completely overwhelmed and i don't feel like i have a choice.

"feeling 'normal'... but that scares me a bit. my gp still haven't put me on mood stabilizers. i am only on sertraline till my next appointment. which sent me on a bad, bad manic episode. my first episode which felt as real and dangerous as it could, to the point i have a scar on my face because i'd cut it. that is how serious it was. i didn't spent money nor had sex, i was however extremely paranoic, had too much energy, was hallucinating, my self-esteem was sky-high... at the time it was good, but now that i am back to myself... i am terrified of it. i hate it. every moment of happiness i am scared that shit is starting again. 


however, now, i am... fine. i am not depressed. which i was expecting, because i would always crash. i had an horrible depression that lasted 4 years, and it was packed with anxiety and panic attacks... it messed me up. i didn't finish school, nor do i have a job. i am a 23 yo that can't get its life right because of a crippling depression and anxiety. but for the very first time ever since my 13s (yes, i had panic attacks this long), i am feeling fine. but this is scary? i am not sure if sertraline is dealing with my depression and is doing a good job at it. but the fear of getting manic again because of sertraline is making my anxiety peak at night. last night i woke up 4 times because i was hearing my dad call me, and then it was my mom, but really they weren't saying things... it was my imagination. but while i feel fine, this fear is so, so bad. i always think ""am i hallucinating again?"". 



thoughts like ""in a few days i will either be depressed or manic again"" makes me extremely worried. and so is my family. they are very supportive, and they felt so powerless last time it scared them to death. every time i say ""i am so happy today"" my mom asks me if i had a good night of sleep or if i am feeling like a bit high. same for my sister and my dad. questions like ""you okay? for real?"" is turning out to be too common.

i'm a googler and it's really starting to piss me off! every single pain i get i end up googling it and lose my shit thinking it's cancer or something deadly. heck, sometimes i don't even google it and i just assume it's something bad! the anxiety got that bad in the summer time that i was crying every night and having no sleep thinking i was going to die and couldn't get out of bed for work. i'd literally made my self depressed. i then did actually get really ill from all the worry and stress. i just don't want to have death thoughts everytime i feel a pain or a niggle! i'm even getting scared of feeling my own breasts incase i feel a lump!!! i also hate it when i see articles on facebook telling you the symptoms to look out for for certain cancers and then those symptoms are stuck in my brain for life and i end up tying those symptoms to my pains and thus the anxiety begins! i'm literally stressed and on edge every single day now, it's exhausting!

so my question is, is there anybody else out there suffering with this too? and how are you coping with it? i literally can't go on like this, feeling like i'm going to die all the time. it's an absolute waste of life.

"major study ""the debate is settled - anti depressants do work"" ""scientists say they have settled one of medicine's biggest debates after a huge study found that anti-depressants work.

the study, which analysed data from 522 trials involving 116,477 people, found 21 common anti-depressants were all more effective at reducing symptoms of acute depression than dummy pills.

but it also showed big differences in how effective each drug is.""

major takeaways: 

edit: anti depressants do work better than placebos for most people but their effectiveness varies.

more people could be helped by anti-depressants.

anti depressants don't work for everyone.

"switching meds, planning pregnancy, and moving across country. recipe for disaster? for context i have type one and a history of 4 hospitalisations in 7 years. ect (worked amazingly but only for a while), tried loads of medications and it seems like we've finally found a combo that works. i haven't had a serious episode for over two years now. 

i have a two year old son and, despite the manic episode i had after four days is labour when he was born, he's the best thing that has ever happened to my mental health. i love him to bits even though he was a surprise and i was totally sure i wasn't ready.

now my husband and i want a sibling for him. we both never had siblings of our own, so he has no cousins and we both wish we had siblings. we want a baby sooner rather than later because the age gap keeps getting bigger. 3 years difference is ok, but 4 seems like much more to me. i don't know. i've started taking folic acid and we should be ready to start trying to conceive in may. 

we also happen to be moving across the uk for my husband's work in july. if all goes well, i could be pregnant by then.

i told my psychiatrist this and he told me that my antidepressant, clomipramine, is dangerous to the baby in pregnancy and can cause serious heart defects. he wants to switch me to an ssri (citalopram), which i've tried several of and they haven't done much for me in the past. clomipramine worked for me i think because it's also effective in ocd and while i don't have ocd, my depressive thoughts are definitely obsessive. i've been taking clomipramine for since a mild depressive episode i had a year ago and since i haven't had any depression at all and i haven't gone manic either.

i'm just worried with the move (even though i'm really looking forward to it) and the pregnancy and the medication change might be too much. as a mother, i feel having a serious episode is not an option, but then am i just putting more pressure on myself? is this crazy? should i try it or wait another year with the baby? even just changing medication worries me, but i can't consider pregnancy without doing that first.

my previous job was working for a guy building some side projects (mostly web3 based stuff), but we didn't run with any of them.

well, a few weeks ago he told myself and the 1 other dev he hired that he needs to focus on his primary business, since that's keeping him too busy to really get stuck into anything with us.

it's understandable and he was even awesome enough to hook us both up with jobs at a another startup.

at first i was pretty excited, since this startup is also web3 based and most of my knowledge and skills involve blockchain tech.

well, as it turns out they're primarily making use of the mean stack (more specifically ionic) and up until a few weeks ago, i had 0 experience with that stack.

my experience is primarily writing smart contracts with solidity and i would say i'm probably even above average, when it comes to it.

i also have a little experience when it comes to react/next and nest.js

unfortunately for me, even though they're a web3 company, they don't need much in the way of smart contracts, and what they do need is a full stack mean dev...

i'm pretty much either learning the tech, working, going to the gym here and there or sleeping.

i still feel like i haven't learned enough fast enough though and i'm pretty sure i'm going to lose this job...

if i do, i don't know what i'm going to do and that scares me and seriously gets me down.

"hi! today i feel like typing until i feel better somehow....i am currently 25 years old and life has not been easy at all. struggles all the time and i guess everybody goes through some issues during their lifes and its ok.my mom was 18 when i was born, she did not finish high school and got married with the guy that i am supossed to call father. he was into drugs, so he got my mom into them as well... like that they had 4 more children, and we all live under the same roof, in a small room, at a hotal room that of course my parents never pay and just run away ... or anywhere we could stay. i was such a baby but still i remember some of the places we used to live and it was not good at all...many things happened during the 7 first years of my life, mostly horrible things but here i am... my parents got so into the drugs and all so they became criminals and wherever we used to live, people knew and got afraid of them, some parents used to tell their children to not hang with me and my brothers, and at that time i did not understand what was going on but now i do.so after that, when i was 7 years old, my grandparets decided to take us 5 (4 brothers and i) to live with them and get a better life. they have given us education, a place to live, a family, experiences, everything... i cannot complain about the lifestyle they provided to us because it was all good but there is a dark side of the story.we have been living with my grandparents 18 years now, and i have not seen my parents in all this time. its ok i guess... but i wish i could take out so many things i have inside my head and my heart in order to feel better. i am not happy and i feel that i have not been happy ever. i want to know what would be like to have a happy life at least for few days...i should stop it now, its just making me cry and all... well, thank you to anyone who reads this. if nobody reads it its also ok. hi!",Suicidal,390

"i'm 16 and going through hell. my anxiety exists due to my high heart rate and i have some questions. i've been dealing with this crap for almost 3 years. it all started with a bad infection that almost costed me a finger. since then i've thought i had cancer, autoimmune diseases, genetic disorders, neurological disorders, diabetes, severe mental issues beyond anxiety, and a whole bunch of crap. luckily, i saw how ridiculous this was before it got too severe (hehe it probably is but not as much as it could possibly get). 

now my problem is my heart. i know it is supposed to speed up when having stress, anxiety or panic, i know why my fingers tingle, i know why i hyperventilate and how it makes things worse, i know why i get headaches, i know! my issue is that it speeds up in a way that i think is too fast. for example, during anxious moments my heart rate is around 100-120: normal and i understand. during panic attacks my heart rate is about 180-205: not normal. 
my question is if anyone relates to this? 

the funny (not really funny) thing about anxiety is that the symptoms cycle. anxiety is a smart cookie who knows how to fool you pretty bad. i've been writing down everything since this started and i've learned a lot about how it works. i've solved my past ""diseases"" by finding the flaw in my thinking process but this time i can't. i can count my heart rate when it is  that fast. i believe heart anxiety is one of the most difficult ones to beat because the heart does some weird things that we're not supposed to feel but anxiety allows you to. i get ectopic beats ( my heart stops for a few seconds and then beats strongly again) which i know are normal but i feel them and people are not supposed to feel them. it's all due to my anxiety. 

anyway, i'll repeat my question again: does anyone else gets heart rate of 180 to 205 bpm during panic attacks? ",Anxiety,351

i think is partly why i have avpd to start with. i guess this could be classed as some form of emotional neglect, not having my feelings validated or taken seriously to the point where i've had to deal with my trauma by myself.",Personality disorder,104

then last week seemed to get better. i was still procrastinating but managed to get some work done. was feeling really stable. able to get back on top of hobbies like cooking/baking and reading. disordered eating was getting back in check (i was bingeing for the month before). made time to watch a bunch of movies.

the academic quarter is ending next week. i'm feeling better so naturally i decide to catch up on the coursework i missed. it's a shit ton of work so for the past few days i've been getting something like 5 hours of sleep. well i guess the stress and the lack of sleep is enough to send me manic again despite being on risperdal. fuck this. i miss the euphoric, godlike, powerful mania. i just can't sleep and can't focus. when i wasn't getting sleep for the past few days i was fucking exhausted the whole time and now i feel wired as hell.

"some advice to my people hello,

i've been suffering with anxiety and panic attacks my whole life, and while i take a ridiculous amount of meds for it including lorazapam, pregablin etc, i was informed about magnesium and i wanted to share this with you.

so a lot of us get anxiety attacks triggered by the stress hormone cortisol, magnesium works by by stimulating the production of melatonin and serotonin which boost your mood and help you sleep. magnesium also reduces the production of cytokines and cortisol, which lead to increased inflammation and stress.

it's important that you don't over do it as you can poison yourself with magnesium, and you also have to make sure it's aspartate, citrate, lactate, and chloride forms as oxide apparently doesn't absorb as well.

speak to your pharmacist or dr if you're mixing medication, but i have been able to reduce the amount of lorazapam i've needed since starting mag and its helped a lot with sleep. i'm truly impressed.",Anxiety,166

about three months ago i was bitten on the leg by a small dog while out on a run. it was a small bite, barely broke the skin, and it turned out to be my neighbor's dog. she was very understanding and even emailed me the dog's vaccination records. i also checked in last week and the dog is still alive and well.

despite this, i started getting symptoms the other day and i cannot. stop. freaking. out. i keep convincing myself i'm getting pain or tingling near the bite site, plus i have all my usual anxiety symptoms again (nausea, insomnia, loss of appetite, brain fog) which are all signs of rabies onset. i've done all the research, i know there's basically no chance of getting rabies from an animal that's still alive weeks later but nothing will put my mind at ease. i can't shake the feeling that i should have gone to the doctor and gotten shots and now i'm going to die in agony for it. has anyone else dealt with this? is there anything i can do to navigate the anxiety surrounding this particularly horrifying disease?",Anxiety,260

"sick and tired of being sick and tired. haven't posted in a while but.... here goes. 

quick background: bp1, lamictal, welbutrin, benztropine, hydroxyzine.

so, i have a appointment with my pdoc this afternoon.... and i really feel like i need a med change of some sort. long story sort i went inpatient last year around july for a full blown psychotic manic episode after taking ssris for months and not realizing they were in fact driving me bat shit crazy. they kept me in the hospital for 16 days on a cec, which i think i'd the max without a court order. i went ""home"" slightly less delusional than when i went in, still not well by any means. this subsided as time passed and with med compliance. as i came down i was in a mixed state for a while and eventually wound up crashing into what i was hoping was only a depressed episode, the only thing is that i have not come out of it for almost a year now. furthermore at this point it doesn't feel like my depressive lows of the past. i feel more detached from life than ever and i am constantly, obsessively  plagued by the thought that somehow i will stumble upon some kind of joy that i once understood. i have lost any and all drive that i once had..... personal improvement, professional advancement, sexual intamacy, intamacy of any kind for that matter, it has all been lost somewhere in the past. it feels like when you misplace your keys  and need to get out of the house quickly because you are already running behind for an ""important"" event.  every minute that passes while you look for the keys you know you are falling further and further behind and then you start to regret not making an intentional effort to put them where they could be found after you last used them.... but as they say hindsight is 20/20.  finally you look up and realize that even if you did find you keys at this point that you likely wouldn't make it until after the events concludes anyway, so what's the point in stressing over it now, worry about it tomorrow...... rinse and repeat. my life has become a series of repetitive movements, each step trying to make it to the next hoping it will be easier, but it's not. each night trying to fall asleep and telling myself that i will wake up rested an refreshed to take on the day, but i won't. i don't want sympathy, i don't want attention, i just want to feel better, i truly just want to be well. whatever the hell that means.

i've been under a lot of stress at work for a long time. i'm responsible for the finances in a company which has been teetering on the edge of bankruptcy for several years, and in september i had my first ever panic attack over worries that we wouldn't be able to make payroll. i know intellectually that the symptoms i'm experiencing can rationally be explained by this, but still. i can't stop thinking about it. i've felt over the past few months that i can't think or write as fluently as i could. i make more mistakes. i feel scatterbrained and foggy, and i struggle to concentrate. i feel like it takes me longer to do things that should be much easier than i'm finding them.

it's led me to start compulsively and repeatedly testing myself on things i ""should"" know, which of course makes the anxiety and racing thoughts worse. can't instantly recall all my pins and passwords? dementia. can't find the right word while i'm talking? dementia. repeat myself while i'm typing a sentence? dementia. can't remember who starred in that film i saw last week? dementia. can't remember every detail of my journey to work? dementia. it's taken me ages to write this. dementia.

flash forward a few years, and i see myself sat in a chair unable to recognise my family :-(. it's horrible.

i just wanted to get this out. i know there are a lot of people in this sub who will have fellow feeling. hope you're all doing ok.",Anxiety,371
"sorry if this sort of thing is not allowed, i just need to tell someone.i tried to kill myself when i was six, and once again a year later. i have never stopped being suicidal, i had to go to the hospital when i was 14 because i felt like i would kill myself. since i was 12-13, i have been planning on killing myself when i am 19, the only reason why i did not kill myself when i was 14 was because i wanted to give myself a few more years for my life to get better. i have 2 years until i am 19, my life has only gotten worse. i have been saving up to get a (mentally) life saving surgery when i am 18. my family struggles with money and my dad does not pay child support, i want to kill myself so the money for the surgery can go to my family. paying for one funeral will be a lot cheaper than spending money on me for the rest of my life when i will never even be happy. depressed",Depression,186

"how did buspirone/buspar make you feel? did you take it consistently or only as needed? hi anxious friends! i recently switched my meds from effexor to prozac and added buspirone 10mg for anxiety. my doctor told me to take it as needed, but after all the research ive done, this doesn't make sense to me. how would it even be effective if i only took it as needed, if it's not a fast/immediate acting drug? it builds up in your system over time, right? so i'd need to take it consistently for a long period of time to feel any effects? ill ask my doctor too of course, but im very interested in other people's experiences with buspirone specifically, and whether you took it as needed or daily. 

ive been taking 10mg 3x a day for about a month (with some missed doses in between) and i do feel less anxious, but the way my doctor described it made it sound like it was a fast acting anti anxiety drug that calms you down after you take a dose, rather than one that builds in your system over time. if it matters, i also take concerta and bupropion. 

thanks friends :)",Anxiety,201
"has anyone here had any experience with legally taking time off high school? hello everyone! i'm a high school student who was a month ago diagnosed with bipolar ii. i'd been having depressive episodes for about a year, and a month and a half ago started experiencing manic episodes as well, which was the reason why i decided to see a doctor. i'm still very early in my treatment, don't yet have a psychiatrist and won't for another month or two (thanks, american health insurance) and i've been having a really hard time coping. i've always been a very high achieving student, getting straight a's every semester, and doing my best not to miss school. this year, however, has been different. due to my bipolar disorder, i've now missed a month of school, have had to drop 3 classes, and i really don't know what to do at this point. my mental health takes top priority, so i am certainly not planning on sacrificing my health and safety for school. i'm feeling really hopeless and lost, and balancing school, work, and my illness just isn't possible anymore. i plan on going to college next year, but i'm afraid that my absences and now failing grades are going to affect my ability to get scholarships. i really just need to take this year off without ""dropping-out"", so i can get the help i need. i was wondering if anyone here has any advice or similar experiences. i live in new york in case that matters. sorry for the wall of text.",Bipolar,260

"could i be bipolar? for years i've been dealing with what feels like cycles of depression. i'll descend into a deep depression over the course of 2-3 weeks and then immediately feel great (but not manic) for a few days before the cycle starts again. in the past year the depressions have gotten worse to the point of me attempting suicide twice and self-harming frequently. 

i now see a therapist and psychiatrist and they've put me on lamictal, wellbutrin, and abilify. i've tried several meds and lamictal has by far been the most helpful in keeping me emotionally stable, without significant side effects.

my psychiatrist has diagnosed me as having major depressive disorder. he claims i'm not bipolar because i haven't experienced any manic episodes, but i don't feel like mdd fully describes my symptoms.

could weed have been responsible for triggering my disorder?

so last night in the middle of my manic episode, i just had this moment apologizing to my partner for keeping him up with my crying. i didn't sleep at all and i just was angry about that. i'm really good at masking most of the time. i have to be, as i work in retail. but then i come home and sometimes i absolutely unravel. 

the part about this is that my logical bits of my brain know better. i know that all the terrible things my brain tells me during my episodes is not true. i know that i can do better. it's as if i'm paralyzed and there's a disconnect between all the parts of my brain. it's fucking horrible and exhausting! 

i am medicated, i am really bad at remembering to take my medications so do you have any tips to help this? i also have a slew of other alphabet soup stuff going on with me.

i've just sent off an email for a volunteering work, it's a simple museum carer, i will take care of the gardens, the tourists and whatever needs available.

this isn't anything, ""o new situation fear"" no i've been to the museum once or twice and know the people, i know the community. 

but i am so damn fucking scared of rejection. i am scared of the possible outcomes this will bring me. i am scared of the social aspects of it.
i keep getting these thoughts of, ""they'll think i'm a creep"" ""i'll probably never keep up with it because i am a pathetic good for nothing, lower to everyone else"".
it's hurting me. 

and i need advice on how to just keep going, what should i do once it starts? fight through the thoughts and fears?

it was already hard enough as it was to do the paper, now i'm crashing wondering ""what the fuck was i thinking!?""

"healthy anxiety worst nightmare! -&gt; hpv hi all,

a year ago i found out that i had a wart in my throat ""possibly linked to hpv"". it was removed and biopsy confirmed as benign. hpv, specifically hpv-16 found to be a major risk factor for oral/throat cancers possibly contracted by kissing, oral sex, towels and other methods.

it triggered major health anxiety within me and my life practically ended. i quit my job, i stopped any type of intimate relationships and basically waiting for life to have a miserable cancer ending.

i did about 10 times oral sex in my life in total (about 5 different women) and now i'm certain i contracted hpv in my throat according to the statistics that everyone got that virus.

i don't even know if i should vaccinate (i'm 36) because the manufacturer itself says it could increase the risk of cancer if you already got infected with hpv-16/hpv-18.

yes i know in 90% the immune system clears it, in the rest of the cases, you are as good as dead.

there is no cure, there is no test and i'm positive i'm headed for cancer. 

i tried doctors, gps, ents, cbt therapists, alternative therapists, nothing works for me.

my life is practically over.

i considered to start taking ahcc pills which women (and some preliminary trial) claim can help clear hpv faster just in case i did contract it (i can never know).

eventually one of my friends showed up and soon after his friend left (this left,  me, my friend and him at a table that seats 4 people) soon after one of my other friends showed up so all the stats at the table where filled. we where all just working quietly for around an hour. after that hour he later  left and my friends left soon after. i spent another hour there by myself finishing up some work 

i am a big glancer i look around a lot whenever i am doing something so this has caused me and this boy to make a lot of eye contact. when i was taking a break from my work i saw him coming back into the building me and him made eye contact and he quickly walked away this was a bit of a surprise because he usually sits down 

i assumed that he either wanted the table for himself or he had some friends coming and needed a bigger table. so i moved seats i got up and went to a single table. i went to go fill up my water bottle after i placed my stuff down at the new table, when i was walking back to my new table i made eye contact with him again because he was walking the same direction. 

i sat down at my new table and put my airpods in assuming that he moved to the table that sat 4 people, out of the corner of my eye i saw him walk up to my table. i took my airpods out and he asked me ""hey, you didn't move seats because of me right?"" with ought even thinking i just quickly shook my head and said  ""oh no!"" before i could say anything else he said ""ok i was just making sure, have a nice day"" and he walked away.

is he referring to ensuring that healthcare is readily available to americans living with mental illnesses? or that those who have mental illnesses will be receiving assistance in obtaining treatment?

2) why is it that the only time people speak to mental health as an issue, as  a priority, is when a lot of people are dead? why is the culpability always on mental illness and never on a negligent gun legislation?

i made her see the doctor but she just went for a normal checkup instead of asking for an ultrasound. they did take a blood sample but that is hardly enough to rule this out right?

"i have entered what i would probably characterize as the darkest period of my life so far. i am in a job i despise, and i recently started therapy, which has overall been a net positive, but it is also forced me to take a long and hard look at many personal traits of my own that need a a lot of work. i am realizing i do not have a strong sense of personal identity and that i have a much lengthier and more problematic track record of behaving in toxic and manipulative ways. all-in-all: my opinion of myself is quickly rocketing into the dirt and i am in the midst of the most intense identity crisis i have ever experienced.all of this and a slew of other unpleasant factors have left me feeling like i am heading right for a potentially explosive breakdown. like, i am about to get married and i love my fiance very much, but making a lifelong commitment like that to another human being when i myself feel like i have no clue who i am, what my values and passions are, or where i am heading in life scares the shit out of me. i have also recently began indulging some self-harm impulses (which are relatively minor and not life-threatening or scarring) for the first time in over a decade which feels like such an enormous step backwards for me. i feel like a rubber band stretched to the brink of snapping and some unknown combination of time and/or additional tension will inevitably make me snap. i do not know what to do about it, because the more i think about the state i am in, the more i feel like i am spiraling out of control. but i also feel like i cannot not think about it because ignoring and repressing my problems and my mistakes is how i ended up here in the first place. the worst part is that, even though i can feel the meltdown coming, i feel powerless to stop it. which is kind of how i would sum up my current crisis: a complete loss of control over my life and the direction it is going in.has anyone experienced anything like this before? if so, any tips on how to deal with yourself or at least keep yourself from hurting others while your life is unravelling? even if not, i appreciate having the space to vent.

"phobia of appendicitis, anxiety whenever i get any tingling sensation in my stomach, i'm in a vicious circle hello, i've been feeling pretty weird for about 15 days now, and i want to share a bit of backstory to help you understand better
6 or 7 years ago, i felt a huge discomfort around my abdominal belt, so much that almost had to sleep standing up because it was the most confortable position for me, i went to a doctor and he shoved his hand in my lower stomach so hard i screamed in pain, he said it was appendicitis even though the pain was coming from him and him only, and he rushed me to the hospital. after a day of stress they announce me that i'm fine and that i just have to take some medication because there was a problem with my nose for some reason.

because of that experience, any small tingling sensation in my stomach puts me in a state of anxiety, my heart rushed, i feel heat around my head, i want to throw up and i have diarrhea, which are common symptoms for appendicitis, so i end up in a vicious circle.

i've been suffering from anxiety and depression for a while now, and i'm pretty inactive at the moment, i'm a lot on my computer but ever since too weeks i've been feeling stomach discomfort for sitting too long, which triggered my anxiety through the roof and messed up my digestive system, going from constipation to diarrhea every few days, i also suffer from lower back pain. 
after a night of drinking yesterday, i'm now left with anxiety and hangover, and an annoying discomfort in my right flank area, parallel to my arm under my ribs, which doesn't help my anxiety.

had i not irrationally quit my job last fall esp when i knew the new job offer i had was not in stone yet, i feel that i would of been on the path of moving out finally, and since then im starting to realize that i may never obtain that goal. i'm in the it profession and frankly a trigger lately is helping my mother especially with it issues almost every single day, often times things i have shown her before how to resolve but then she sits there and claims i never had which further enrages me and triggers me to start rapid cycling again.

my anxiety stems from the fact that people with retinal migraine are at a higher risk of experiencing seizures and strokes.

then there is this: i was prescribed wellbutrin last week to help with getting out of bed in the mornings (coupled with venlaflaxine). my psych informed me that drinking alcohol can result in a seizure while on wellbutrin. in addition, so can combining wellbutrin and aspirin/advil. he said tylenol is ok, and i checked online for any drug interactions, too, which confirmed that it should be ok. i have a cold today and an upset stomach, so i took some tylenol cold &amp; flu pills to relieve it.

and then i spent the rest of my evening preoccupied by the idea of having a seizure because i took tylenol. i even contemplated seriously telling my boss that i could have a seizure, along with wanting to tell my coworker that if i am on the ground shaking uncontrollably that it is a seizure and to call an ambulance.

they are not really related in any genre way but all feature some sort of disconnect with the mcs and the rest of the world. it's like you're just traveling through it and never really putting down roots but instead just observing for a while and then moving on, they all sort of have this somber undertone that you're not really a part of the world and just experiencing small parts of it. 

most of them feature a pair traveling together which makes it feel less lonely but mushishi only has the mc and that's the one that feels closest to avpd in a weird way in my mind.

does this make sense?",Personality disorder,162
i'm so used to being forced to submit to him that i no longer have a voice. he heavily favors my sister over me and would buy her anything she wanted in a heartbeat. an example would be at darvin furniture one time. he takes me and my sister there and tells her to pick out a desk. i look at a $100 discount desk and he says we don't have enough money.,Stress,73

"hello there,i feel genuinely stressed all the time and i cannot explain it properly as i am not comfortable about it but i cannot stop being triggered by the smallest things linked to my childhood (one of them being wwe as my biological father loves wwe) and i tried to explain it to someone close to me recently and they said these exact words ""it is funny how i have depression and now all of a sudden now you have it"" and it is really cut deep into my brain today. it just feels like whenever i open up to people i consider family and friends irl, they just push me away and then because i feel like i am melting, i end up leaking my feelings and thoughts on social media where it gets screenshotted and used against me and like i really cannot handle this stuff anymore. i screwed up my one chance i had to go to university thanks to losing intrrest in my college course thanks to losing my great-grandfather and i just fell so hard and if i am honest with the exception of a few months in late 2019-early 2020, i have not really ever got over it.another thing that has made me angry is that imy coping mechanism for severe depression (eating) has now became my because of it, it is fucking unfair and i am so fed up with it. i am 22 years old and feel like no matter what happens, i am always going to be unemployed, always going to be lonely and always going to be living with my mother and never actually do anything with myself. feeling depressed all the time",Depression,283

"i am not sure when i will kill myself, that largely depends on how things turn out and largely random chance and circumstances. but it will probably be sometime in the next couple of years. it does not really make me feel sad, because once you are dead you do not exist, so nothing you did matters. it makes me feel so relieved that all of the bullshit in my life and all my stupid decisions can just not be my problem any more. life is hard and i am not very tough, and i am stupid enough to consistently unwittingly sabotage myself. offing myself literally solves all my problems at once, i am surprised more people do not do it. but most people also bring children into the world to suffer, and i do not understand the reasoning behind that either. i do not view my own suicide as something tragic. it is a relief.",Suicidal,156

"as the title suggests i had planned to kill myself last night. precisely the plan was to electrocute myself as it does not really require a lot of prep. i will not go into details about the specific act due to the fear someone might attempt to recreate it. anyways, that would have been my second suicide attempt, the first one being about a year and a half ago with me stabbing myself in the neck a few times. not the most elegant suicide method i admit but i was not looking for something elegant at the time. i was diagnosed with dysthymia (persistent depressive disorder) about 3 years ago, changed a few therapists and medications but nothing helped enough. it just feels like life has just been postponing suicide since my first attempt. on the bright side, i have not self-harmed since then but hell do i want to sometimes. in every bridge, every speeding car, every kitchen knife, every rope, every policeman even all i see is a way to death. the main question that people might have from the title - did i go through with it? no. why? i do not know really, instead, i went for a run (which is usually a temporary mood boost for me but it goes away quite quickly) and then i was too tired to do it. do i still want to do it? yes, yes and yes. i only stopped myself today too because a friend of mine has her birthday today and i do not want to ruin it even if we are not really close. it is just all postponing but i am not sure until when. anyways, thanks for your time, hope you are doing better! i had a suicide attempt planned for last night.",Suicidal,299

"just when i think i've made it, i get pulled back in. i've had so many tests, painful and otherwise, over the past several weeks.  after finally getting a nearly clean bill of health, i brought up with my doctor the one thing i didn't think about until recently. i could feel a swollen lymph node just under my jaw over my carotid artery.  what started to scare me, is that i realized i could feel that lymph node for something like 3 *months*.  my doctor immediately ordered an ultrasound, and this morning i got a really somber call from a nurse at the dr.'s office saying i needed to see an ent right away: i not only have the one, but *multiple* enlarged lymph nodes in that area.  my understanding is that the concern from my doctor is not just that there are multilple and they're enlarged (at least one is on the order of 2cm), but that at least one has persisted for so long, and even more alarming, i have no signs of an infection and my bloodwork is clean; apparently persistent enlarged, multiple lymph nodes with clean bloodwork is not a good sign.

i've been freaking out all day and i've been trying to avoid the internet, but the soonest i can get in to see an ent is next tuesday, so i get to spend the next 4+ days agonizing about this. i'm 38 years old, and i've been through so many health symptom scares over the past couple of months (mostly heart related) that the anxiety is just making me lose my mind...",Anxiety,269

then last night, i laid down in bed and my bpm immediately sunk down to 52. i was up for three hours laying in bed bc i couldn't fall asleep over anxiety over my heart rate. i checked it on my fitbit and manually constantly and it was often hovering between 47 and 50. laying in bed typing this now after having stood up for a while it's 59.

"got prescribed inderal (propranolol) so i went to my gp (general practitioner aka your family doctor) and told her i had been feeling anxious lately, especially before big exams or oral presentations (i start shaking and feeling physically sick, unfocused, can't think straight, etc). she gave me a prescription for inderal and told me to take it on days when i have exams or big events.

however, i googled and it just looks like something to lower your blood pressure. so not that i'm complaining because, honestly, anything helps, but isn't this just going to treat the physical symptoms instead of the overlying issue aka the anxiety? it just sounds like i'll still have the mental anxiety, just with a lower heartbeat lmao

is this it or should i keep trying to find a better state to be in?  i mean i can live with it, but it sucks to go through this rollercoaster of emotions and energy expending and depleting, even if it's just a mid-sized one. i cancel a lot of plans on friends often because the way i feel when making them is not how i feel when the date arrives, i still have these insane urges to make plans with people and go out and socialize, shop, google search like mad and try new stuff, i still sleep less and more depending on what stage i'm in, i still overstress over everything and panic, i still feel drained and prefer to be alone and do nothing for a month or so straight.

"swelling under ""xiphoid process"", results in mental issues and gastrointestinal tract issues hello,

i am 27 years old male. i am a lonely guy that drinks a lot of beer. i drink only beer intentionally, so that the harm of alcohol is less. 


recently, however this is still becoming an issue. i let my alcohol addiction to beer to overrule my healthy life. i smoke a lot of cigarrettes and i drink beer every day. i also drink so much coffee. my life is good, but recently i feel this anxiety. my overall performance is getting lower too.


a few months ago i noticed that i have swelling exactly bellow my ""xiphoid process"". it is something internal. i have gastrointestinal tract issues. i feel stomache discomfort, as well as drifting issues regularly. i researched about symptoms and could not get any information about it...

recently i feel a lot of anxiety and it is messing my decisions and mental health already. i think this could turn into dementia or something serious. it could be a cancer, as well, i don't know.


i could have possibly gone to a doctor, but the problem is that i come from a poor family and owe around 500 euro for health care, which i cannot spend at this point. 

i hope you guys could help me identify the possible reasons for all this, so i can make some adequate response to it.. and i will see a doctor soon probably. i am just a bit scared and unaware of what i did to myself. 


hope you guys support me and give me advice, thanks!

**edit;** also, i have been very anxcious around people ever since child. every time i talk to someone, i feel something like pain in my stomache and have to make effort for all my conversation. i ended up a quiet and lonely guy because of it. this is the whole reason i abuse alcohol, cigarrettes and coffee. i wanted to overcome something psychological to be more connected. this abuse was obviously affecting my digestive system or something.. i don't know. i know that this will become a nightmare and could possibly be the reason for my death some day.

**edit:** sorry, i am actually 30 years old male. i am so embarrased right now.

"i have been going to therapy for the past 2 years now. i have had 4 different psychologists and 2 psychiatrists in my life. i have had to take breaks every now and then because it just makes me angry all the time, even outside of therapy and there have been waiting periods when i have switched to a new therapist but for the most part i have been in therapy pretty consistently. and i have to say i just do not get it.i have already heard all the you are not letting it work, you are doing this to yourself kind of statements so ill start by saying i have always tried my absolute hardest to keep an open mind and do the things they say no matter how ridiculous it sounds to me. but i just do not see how its supposed to help people at all. all i have been told to do over and over again is stupid, pointless things like journaling or meditation or mindfulness or breathing exercises and they just do not do anything. they do not make the suicidal thoughts go away, they do not help me out of a depression or make life more tolerable in anyway. i have had all the sessions where they try to unpack and explain the reasons behind some of the things i do and how its linked to specific trauma, but again, that knowledge does not help me at all. it does not fix anything to know where it came from, its not some hollywood movie where having someone explain your past to you gives you some life changing breakthrough, it means nothing to me.i just do not see what its supposed to be doing for me and i am finding it really hard to believe that it would work for anyone that is not just completely lacking any kind of self-awareness or someone who actually liked talking about their problems as a form of processing them. the medication they give me has not done a fucking thing either.its not even that therapy is not working for me, but i was hoping that by doing it for a while id at least be able to understand how its *supposed* to help but i cannot make any sense of it at all. it honestly just feels like a scam to me more and more every time i go, like its just designed to take money from vulnerable people under the false pretence they can actually get better. i just do not understand.maybe its just me though, maybe i am just broken i do not understand therapy at all",Depression,441

anyways, what i'm getting at is, i saw myself in the mirror when i walked in, and i couldn't help but think that i look exactly how i want to look. i love how comfy clothes look, my hair is long and messy, and i guess i'm in a good enough state of mind to see myself as cute when my hair covers my face like it did. i am embarrassed that as a guy, i like feeling cute, but i think it's great and i've been told that it actually makes me more attractive. 

but when i was admiring myself in the mirror, i lifted up my hoodie (no i don't wear a shirt underneath my hoodies, the temperature much too hot for that as i can barely wear this hoodie) and i saw that my waist was super skinny. of course, i don't eat much, and i still function fine, so i guess that's okay. 

what i'm getting at is, i was able to look at myself in the mirror today, and i liked what i saw, and people can think what they want, i look exactly how i want to look today, and i love that.

this is what gives me health anxiety. there's nothing i can do about it. all my doctors including my mayo cardiologist and electrophysiologist says an ablation would more than likely make things worse. so i live with these day in and day out. i've tried everything. the best thing i have is magnesium glycinate

https://www.reddit.com/r/menstruation/comments/af32dw/i_wanna_talk_about_menophobia_my_story/

my period is the main cause of my anxiety. i'm tired of being ashamed and embarrassed about this. i'm tired of being not like everyone else. i just don't want to put up this anymore. i'd like to add that i haven't started to starve myself, these are just intrusive thoughts. although, i kinda want to stop eating.

i'm not calling this an eating disorder is because it has nothing to do weight or body image. as you can see, this is very complicated. if i do stop eating, i'll take everything into consideration.

the only way for me to be happy is without my period. i'll eat when i don't have my period that month or whatever.

i want to try to conquer my fear of sex/menstruation. but i know i can't do it. people on reddit say that i should try to learn about what's going on in body so that i won't be afraid. i definitely can't do that. i'm a loser because of this.

i blame myself a lot for being this fear. its all my fault. i hit myself from time to time because i feel so stupid. i have not told my family that i think about not eating anything. i feel too guilty to tell someone. people already don't understand why i feel uncomfortable about sexuality and menstruation. life sucks.

uniformly it's pleasurable/risky behavior/ being more goal oriented. i have pretty high self esteem all the time unless i'm depressive so i can't use it to judge (unless it's gotten to the point where i think about running for office or starting a cult, that's pretty obvious)

i don't get flight of ideas, sleeplessness, distracted, pressured speech, etc during these times. when i'm full blown hypo/manic i get at least 50% of the above.

"over the last couple of years i have lost the will to live. i just do not see the point in doing anything anymore. my job has become redundant but i do not wish to change as i do not think any other job is going to be better than the one i have. i cannot hang out with my close group of friends as they are either getting married or are in a serious relationship. cannot socialize anywhere else due to the restrictions brought about by the pandemic. to prevent feeling lonely, i hang out with a group of people who are at least 5-7 years younger to me. but deep down, i feel out of place as they are in a different phase of life and have different interests. no other interests or hobbies. all this makes me lose interest in my life further.for a while i thought i was under a depression as this feeling of nothingness came on suddenly. i convinced myself that the depression is the reason my life is at a low point.but, recently i met a person who was diagnosed with clinical depression. that is when i realised what depression actually is. compared to what the guy was facing, my life was a picnic. i had no problem in functioning and going about my daily life. for a brief moment i was relieved that i was not under depression.however, then the realisation hit me, ""if i am not depressed, then there is only one explanation for this funk in my life: i am just pathetic"". ironically, this realisation of being a pathetic loser made me feel worse than when i thought i was depressed. at least, when i was depressed i could go to a psychologist and get myself treated. being pathetic has no solution. it is just the way i am....if any of you are wondering about relationships..i have never had any. not a single one. it is difficult for me to even maintain good relations with family members. i do not know how to read and react to social situations. all this while my justification for the lack of social skills was due to having asperger's or some other autism. but, now i even doubt that...maybe i just too pathetic to do anything other normal people do. just realised that i am not depressed. just pathetic.",Depression,395

i found this subreddit when researching health anxiety. my long term partner has been afflicted by this for the last 3 months. i know that is not a very long time, but it's been very hard. it feels like he suddenly starting having heart problems and ended up in the er because he called an ambulance. they said it was panic/anxiety, and things have gotten worse since. we have done all the medical tests, and physically the doctors say he is fine and that his symptoms are anxiety. he is convinced otherwise, but i see his behaviors mirrored in all of the posts here. i believe he has health anxiety.

&amp;#x200b;

i'm really trying to be as helpful as i can, but i feel so helpless. i am trying to reassure him that he is okay, but every other day he spirals into believing that he has cancer/kidney disease/muscular disorders/liver cirrhosis, etc etc. he even at one point thought he had an std, which was hurtful to me as his long-term partner because i have not been unfaithful and i viewed it as an attack on my character. i realize now that it is us against the anxiety but sometime's it's still hard. before all of this, we used to go and do things all the time. now it feels like we don't go out and any time i can get him out, it's a chore because he feels so sick (or anxious).

&amp;#x200b;

he has started therapy, but insists it will not help because he thinks he has a true medical problem and not health anxiety. i want to be as supportive as i can be, but i'm really struggling with how to support without enabling or indulging in his fears. 

&amp;#x200b;

so i'm hopeful that this community can help give me some advice on how to help a partner experiencing health anxiety? what is helpful for you to hear from your partners? how can i be the most supportive partner i can be without losing myself (which is how i am starting to feel lately)? should i push or encourage him to go out even when he says he is sick? i miss our old life, but i don't want to force him into an activity if he really is ill. alternatively, is there anything i can do to be more empathetic? what do you wish your partner knew about your health anxiety?

"i have low dopamine and have no motivation because of it, so should i start chasing dopamine to get motivation to get moving? are these things ok to pursue that get me excited:foster kittens, go on a bunch of dates to find my match, have fun with dating men and get high from it(never properly dated at 32 just been single or stuck with losers), get tattoos(do not have any), find sugar daddy to help mentor me in finding my own independence and career in private investigation, get a fun sports car, buy clothes,.........i have not done any of these things and always think about it. i never buy myself clothes. should not i do everything that gets my dopamine flowing as long as its not hurting me?",Depression,128
"should i see my doctor? i'm new here, not diagnosed with any type of stress disorder.

long story short; i'm a 26 y/o female, in a happy relationship, enjoy my studies at uni and my student job. i have friends (not a lot, but i'm an introvert so that fits me) and a loving family. at the same time i have a few diagnosis - an eating disorder, ocd and borderline personality disorder. all of them something i've gotten treatment for, and i have under control.

the reason for this post is new. since my summer vacation ended a month ago, i've had this problem. every time i sit down to do some studying i start crying. i can't concentrate and the more time passes, the farther behind i get. i have a hard time getting started with any task - studying, cleaning, getting to classes, being intimate with my partner, anything. just writing these few lines have taking me half an hour to start, half an hour to write.

my question for you guys is; should i see my doctor about this? or is this just a part of life, and not even a real problem? i don't feel like talking to the people around me about this, i don't want to worry   them if i just need to get myself together...

hope to get some oppinions!",Stress,228
"how do i keep myself from constantly coming into conclusion base on my intuition? hi, i'm peter, 20. recently i've been thinking of bad things happening base on my intuition. most of these bad things are related to my relationship with the people around me. i'm constantly thinking that they have something against me or they're betraying me. this started last year, 2022 after the restriction, because of the pandemic, loosened. i had a group of friends that i was with  and had a few drinks together, had fun, and typical stuff you do with your friends. after a fee months, i felt something was wrong. even though they are not showing it, i feel it that they don't like me. i confronted them about it, and they said ""no"". but few days after that, someone told me what they've been saying about me. i felt betrayed and sad. after that unfortunate incident, i've been having trust issues and i trust my intuition more than ever. 

now, i'm talking to someone. he's sweet and gentle. he works hard and is independent. he talks to me even though he's tired, i really feel that he's someone to keep. but today, i just felt that something's wrong. he called me but he didn't speak. i called him back but didn't answer. i texted him what's wrong, if he's okay. he answered me ""yupp"". that was it, not even an explanation. i don't know if i should tell this guy that what he did triggered my anxiety, and i suddenly felt that he's unto something. i don't want to think much about it because i actually like him. 

should i tell him after his shift or i should keep it to myself and see what the future holds for me?",Anxiety,297

i got a ct scan last month due to head pains ,nausea and dizziness. it was without dye/contrast and the scan came back nornal accorsing to the doctor. i still fear what i fear since i noticed whenever i get slightly annoyed or mad i feel a pressure or slight ache or pain at the top of my head. it even happens when im not getting angry but someone is getting mad at me. now i cant help but think the worst. im scared to sneeze or strain during a bm too. i also notice a squeezing senation like muscles squeezing on the top or back of my head whenever i gwt anxious or come inside from cold weather.

"i just keep throwing away my life. i just don't know what to do anymore. 25 year old female, diagnosed at 18 and have been taking lithium on and off. 

well... i went off my medications again for a few months. i went off when i was done with school receiving a certificate for my future career. well, i felt fine, as i am not working currently so don't really have any stressors. before i went fully off my medications i was not taking them consistently and i quit one of my jobs of 4 years, started a new one (during the time i bought a house and was moving) and quit that one after a few months. the anxiety was the thing that was my problem, i was having massive panic attacks, and just had this intense self hatred for myself which then diminished my self-confidence entirely. especially after just throwing away my life. 

well just recently, i got a job in the career i was going to school for for so many years... and after day 1 i quit because i had a major meltdown. could not keep food and water down, was cold sweats and shaking anxiety, it took me back to last year when i also had a similar meltdown. but this time it was so intense and different. i hate myself for quitting a professional job the next freaking day. how embarrassing, i literally threw away everything and i feel i will never be able to go back again. i now am deeply depressed and anxious. cannot eat, keep waking up in a panic. i wish i never went off my meds, maybe i would have never quit the job and stuck it out. i don't know what my problem is. i just started my meds again, i am only on lithium er. i am currently seeing a psych doc and i have kept her out of the dark about going off my meds and how i have been taking them so inconsistently. i also want to go on the anxiety med she recommended buspar, but i refused to try it because i thought i could beat it myself.. bipolar symptoms i have more control over. i am not sure if this is a part of bipolar or just separate generalized anxiety. 

now everyone in my life thinks i am lazy and just don't want to work. but i do, i just keep fucking up because i won't take my meds. my boyfriend is currently paying all the bills, we just bought a house, so we are living pay check to pay check and i am afraid he will end up leaving me because of this.

"i find it so frustrating as a highly anxious and depressed person to do career tests because they rely on your passion for specific activities and i find myself answering ""i dislike it very much"" to the various questions (e.g,. working in construction, healthcare, finance, whatever). i've been trying to get back to work again because it seems my severe depression and anxiety won't go away and there is only so much medication and therapy can help me. of course, i haven't tried every kind of therapy but what had been offered to me at low cost. but i've tried many medications.

anyhow, i feel very frustrated because after trying couple of online part time jobs (like writing marketing stuff on websites) and finding myself not motivated enough to work sufficient hours to make ends meet, i'm trying to start from zero again and do some career tests to find what motivates me. but those tests don't offer some magical information but just rely on what you're passionate about. like they give you 50 questions and ask you how much you like doing different activities, like installing cabinets, diagnosing disease in people, giving financial advice to someone wanting to get a loan, helping a disabled person get dressed, playing a musical instrument in front of an audience, taking care of sick animals, etc etc etc.

i hate them all! none of these activities excite me. because having a job is always about what others expect of you. but mental illness sucks so much of your energy that there is so little left for the job.

like if i'm a cashier, my high anxiety and depression and the various thoughts and emotions and physical symptoms i experience will take so much of my energy to control and nothing left to put on a smile and make a customer feel welcome and at the same time do my job of scanning items very quickly and correctly.

that's why i've been trying to find jobs that are just online and things i can do on my own time, so that whenever the damned mental health issues give me a break then i can do the job. the problem is there are too many people doing these jobs and they pay so little that i've had to start looking at other options.
