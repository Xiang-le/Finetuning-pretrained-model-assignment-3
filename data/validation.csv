"my friend (f 20) is in a very bad condition right now because of her mother blaming and being very rough on her.background -my friend has an elder sister who is suffering from a mental issue. she is on a lifetime medication which is very expensive. she got married last year after searching for a husband for her for a long time. her mother wanted to have a house-husband for her daughter so that she can take care of her. but my friend denied as it would put more burden on the family which is struggling financially.so her sister got married and went to live with her husband on the condition that her family will pay for her medication as the husband did not do anything. first few months was ok, her in-laws took great care of her. but after that things changed. her condition worsened. she started coming back to her family, sometimes staying even for months. seeing all this her mother started blaming my friend for not allowing her to keep a house-husband. treating her badly. always shouting &amp; screaming at her. at this point she shouts on her for anything!my friend is preparing for medical entrance exam, she wants to be a vet but all this is hurting her badly. she has become very negative and lost her self confidence, i fear she has suicidal thoughts too.i kindly request you all to please advice me how i can help her. she was really good at studies and i want to see her get out of her toxic environment and become a successful vet. we live in india, local support is very much appreciated. need help for my friend",Depression,281

"is blocking out the majority of my childhood a thing? i feel like i can't remember anything before maybe 12, and it's concerning (i'm 20f) i have pretty much no actual memory of my childhood. i know facts about it, but i'm not sure how much of it is just based on hearing stories from my family. i don't remember being excited for my first day of school, or when my little brother was born. i barely remember any of the houses i lived in(there were a number). i don't remember what my relationships with my siblings were like, or conversations with my parents. i literally don't have almost any memories from before i was like 12/13.

the exception being of my dad. i do have some clear, distinct memories of him being an abusive asshole. i remember things being thrown at me, being called fat, being yelled at. but even these i only have a few.

i also have trouble with dates and when things happened. i have a hard time answering questions like ""when did you start this medication"", or ""when was your last dentist appointment""

i have bpii, severe adhd, and i suspect i disassociate sometimes but haven't really discussed that with my doctor. i had a rough upbringing, and have a lot of lasting issues resulting from it.

it makes resolving these issues difficult because i don't have clear ideas of what my childhood was like. i also feel incredibly guilty and sad because my mom died when i was 14, and i don't have as clear memories of her as the rest of my family does.

"scared of heart pumping problem my mom developed cardiomyopathy - inadequate pumping due to weakening of the heart muscle, when i was 8 or 9, i'm 21 now. 
since then she's been on medicines and her condition has improved significantly in last 12 years. 
a few years ago i started having heart palpitations which were more noticeable after i did some exercise. i was af and my parents took me to the er but they said it's just anxiety, but as my mom has this condition, i should get it checked out. 
we went to the cardiologist the next day who ran some tests like ecg, echo and bloodwork and everything came out normal. 
after a few months i stopped noticing the symptoms, even while exercising. 
i still get palpitations when i'm going through a phase of anxiety but rarely otherwise. 

out of curiosity, i surfed the internet about cardiomyopathy and came to know that a person has 50% chance of inheriting the faulty gene from their affected parent and i'm really scared now. 
the articles even mentioned that in some cases the first diagnosis comes to light when a family member dies suddenly, due to cardiac arrest. 
i'm really scared now, of developing this disease now or in the near future and i don't really know what i can do about it. 

i want to mention one more thing that my mom's heart pumping has come back to normal but she still takes the medicine because a condition is a condition, so the prognosis is good in her case. ",Anxiety,260

"brief mourning period for 4 months of stability well, it happened again. hubris is indeed my downfall.

i tried taking vyvanse again, at a lower dose than the previous dose that made me manic. and i was ok for about a week before the symptoms started showing up. namely, lying (about anything) and some risky behaviors. luckily, not drinking and drugs, but i did take a hit off of a vape pen, which i know is super bad for my brain (no matter how much analog weed i can smoke.) i decided on saturday to stop taking it.

and sunday i blew up.

we were having a disagreement about how to best spend our day on sunday. i wanted to stay very busy, and he wanted to take his time. which is no big deal at all and shouldn't have been what set me off. but it did, and i was in the history of pain.

my history of pain is a mindset i get into when manic brain meets remotely challenging parts of my relationship. suddenly, i am the victim of circumstance and have been forever and will be forever: he doesn't love me, he's shown how he doesn't love me in every action, and on top of that, i don't deserve love for how terrible i am and the terrible things i've done.

and then i'm hitting myself in the head over and over and over, and bashing my skull into anything i can get my hands on.

and then it subsides, and i'm crying, and he wants to get away from me, and i don't understand.

and then it's quiet, and he's mad and i'm still crying, and it seems like i'll never stop and we'll never be happy again.

and then it's quiet, and he's quiet and i'm quiet.

and then we're in the car and talking about the news, and all i want is to be held, but that's asking too much too soon.

i should've trusted my body sooner- there were warning signs that the vyvanse was going to push me over the edge, and i went willingly. and why? because vyvanse would help me achieve my goals, surely, but at the cost of myself and him.

everything has a cost, and this cost was too high. sure, he and i are ok now, but there's the threat of so many next times, and eventually, he'll walk.",Bipolar,403

im scared out of my mind right now. the only reason i had sex was because i was feeling kind of depressed and thought sex would help. little did i know that i was going to contract hiv from it :(. i will be a medical phenomenom, i can already see the headlines ""17 year old depressed boy has sex to make himself feel better, ends up contracting hiv instead"". i can't go to the doctor or get a test because im not 18 either. so i have to wait 4 more months until i find out i have hiv",Anxiety,279

i'm turning 21 in april and i've struggled with health anxiety for past 3 and a half years. recently i've been getting better and even managed to get myself into a relationahip which was great.

the thing is, two weeks ago i noticed that i seem to struggle with getting/keeping erections. so i obviously started googling, which was not helpful(as always)  as it said its mostly thing old guys get and so on. what it did notice was a terrifying thing called venous leak, which means your veins can't trap blood for erection, there is no fix for that and you're doomed. so i started stressing over this so badly, i wanted to know everything about it, thing is, out of all my health scares, i never seen a condition so poorly reported, there is very little information about it and no statistics and contradicting facts, which is fueling my anxiety even more. 

so i'm sitting here worrying that surely i must have it and seeing it seems to be very unknown i definitely have it. has anyone heard or knows more about this?

"new panic attack symptoms hi guys , 28 male here, i have been suffering from anxiety most of my life. i had a panic disorder before ( 5 years ago ) that i treated with therapy. i also started using alcohol and it got me addicted. now im sober but the panic attack have started to come back. it all started when trying to fall asleep i got jolts that would wake me up the moment i was entering a sleep state.

doctor as prescribed me 10mg lexapro and i have been on it for a week. i actually feel a little bit worse ? 

i also have bad pvcs ( heart palpitations ) and they are one of the worst offenders of my anxiety.
this morning i had one while driving and it snowball into a panic attack, i had a completely new symptoms : burning sensation in my chest.

as a kid i was described as somewhat masculine, never picked up girl toys and etc but i guess that doesn't really matter.

"thought loops hey, i'm just curious if someone can relate to this. so from time to time i experience something like thought loops on different topics. i'm not sure even how to call it, but, for example, today i spent whole day thinking about that our world seems kinda hollow and that there's something beyond love, family and money. the reason i post it is that it feels somewhat damaging to me. i feel like i have to find the answer and i spend some time doing researches. i just don't know how to be over it and calm about it. so why it feels damaging..i have 2 outcomes: first is logical but i can't accept it, the second is irrational, i can't prove it, but it feels like it's the truth. 
i'm not sure, maybe it's something obvious and i just don't know about. just curious if it is related to bipolar, because my friends say i just need to calm down, but i can't. if you experience it, how do you stop it or what do you do about it? btw, i have bp2",Bipolar,186

"panic, pain and tingling in limbs - is my birth control driving me crazy? hi there everybody! it's my first time posting here but my anxiety is skyrocketing recently, so here's a quick summary of my problem:

i feel constantly stressed and pressured due to mental health reasons. last year, during a very stressful stretch at work, i passed out the first time and i've had dizzy spells ever since. had blood work and an examination with a heart rate monitor made, nothing major except for a slightly lower blood pressure. thought i was going to die the entire time, of course, but it got better then aside from me growing obsessed with my health.

fast forward to today. after stressing for a whole month that i might've gotten myself pregnant i finally started birth control on the 16th, thinking i might finally chill, but nope! now i'm convinced i'm developing a thrombosis or something worse. i had a panic attack last week that my so had to talk me through, thinking i was having a lung ebolism, and now suddenly my right foot, wrist, upper arm and leg hurt, i get tingles in my right little and ringfinger, and occasionally there's this burning sensation around my knee and elbow that just... make no sense whatsoever? travels to my left side sometimes, too, and my hands are often cold.

can someone please tell me that i'm okay? i've been to my doctor so many times this month because of different things and i'm so embarrassed to turn up there so often for little to no diagnosis. i should know my symptoms are too much over the place to be anything serious, but i just want to go through a single day again without me obsessing over every little pin &amp; needle that i'm feeling. :(",Anxiety,305

"questions about ultra rapid cycling/switching/mixed states so i've been cycling since beginning of december, before it was switching back and forth around every 5 days (with about 12 hours of euthymia between the up-&gt;down switch and none in the down-&gt;up switch), but since some time in early feb it's more like switching every 21-34 hours (usually 21-24 but sometimes a cycle gets a bonus half day added to it), and this is with little or no break in between sides.


now this is where my question comes in:  i started on latuda 20 in early feb (which seemed to work for like 3 days a week in then stop).  then feb 22 i got upped to 40 (as well as wellbutrin being doubled from 150-300 o_o).  now since last week (almost exactly 2 weeks after upping the two), the pattern has started doing something extra weird....


now, instead of just going up-down-up-down like it was before, there's a day ""break"" between the solid up and down ... and it's not euthymia it's like a funky mixed thing going on where it rapidly switches back and forth between lighter versions of both sides, with each side ranging anywhere from a couple minutes to an hour.  then it switches into a 'full state' for a day to continue the cycle (usually it goes in order but it doesn't always).

so my question is ... i really can't understand exactly what this means ... does this mean it's getting better or worse?  i'm trying to figure out if maybe the med changes are in the right direction or if this is actually worsening ... in some ways i'd say better (since the number of 'full' cycles is technically slowed a little) but for more obvious reasons it may be worse.  also, these bouncy days are pretty obnoxious when it comes to doing things like work because i can't actually maintain a flow since it keeps changing on me.


has anyone had any sorta situation like this before?  do you think this is a path toward better, or is it actually getting worse?  i would think a question like that would be obvious but ... it isn't for this o_o",Bipolar,366

"i don't know how to explain this. maybe i just need to rant. i've been sober for a year and 3 months. i take my meds everyday without fail. i eat pretty good and try to get outside as much as i can even though i'm a shut in, agoraphobic. i go to therapy. my problems are dealt with, my stressors are at a minimum.

why the fuck am i depressed? why the fuck can't i sleep? seriously, it's almost 8am and now my schedule is completely out the window. i'm not even hypomanic, i don't have any energy. i've been laying here watching youtube, eating left over pizza, just kind of doing nothing. i'm so pissed.

the worst part is, there's a cycle! an actual, honest to god cycle. not just a bipolar cycle where triggers set things off. no no no. this is a biological cycle. you see, i have pcos. and every time i've gotten my period since i was 9 years old, it's made me depressed, moody, bitchy, argumentative, etc. a lot of the time, i start to think this is all from my hormones and i don't even have bipolar. i'd be even more convinced if my lithium didn't work great within 2 days of my first time taking it, and it didn't run rampant in my family. alas, i have the family curse.

but seriously, having pcos is a fucking curse, too. i use the app clue to track my cycle and i just checked it tonight to see where i'm at and realized why i was being such a cunt to my fiance all weekend and never wanted to leave the apartment. why i keep falling asleep later and later in the morning everyday and can't get out of bed until the late afternoon. i'm fucking 25 years old! this is so stupid. i haven't been able to have a job in years because of this and i've never gotten any kind of relief from any doctor.

those fake sun lamps don't help. melatonin doesn't do shit. sleeping pills make me hallucinate. i've been checked for any type of vitamin deficiencies. i try to fix my schedule at least once a month, where i won't sleep for like 30 hours. it's ridiculous, it's the same shit all year every year.

i'm so sorry if this isn't really a bipolar post, i think it is because i feel like my cycle effects my bipolar so much that this happens every month. but i could be wrong, maybe it's just all the hormones and my bipolar is completely fine.

i wish i had an answer. i wish i could find a solution.",Bipolar,447

"back story how i got to where i am. i am 20f and i moved in with my boyfriend a few months ago. everything was going great until i got depressed again. i could take care of myself properly, could not get myself motivated to do anything, slept in later than i should. and my bf tried to help me in a way i told him time and time again that it would not work. for some reason everytime someone in my life pushes me to do things that i am scared of or have a hard time doing, i just shut down completely. i agree i was pretty terrible to live with. some days i helped out so much around the house and other days i could not get myself to do anything at all. i also did not have a job because he would not jump start my car because he was so afraid of me crashing my car on purpose (i would not do that). flash forward to three weeks ago: everything got worse, we started fighting constantly. he told me i should have tried harder and he was right. he said it was killing him to see me like this. he said if i did not get myself fixed or start doing more for myself that hell kick me out. so i slowly started to do more and take care of myself. however, we still fought constantly. i still could not get him to realize how i felt the way i do and could not get him to start my car. so with that being said i still could not get a job and he hated that. flash forwarded again, last night he packed up all of my things and kicked me out. the entire time telling me he felt so bad for doing this but it all my fault. then he got moody and told me that until i get better that we can only be friends. so i was crying hysterically and could not drive myself back to my parents so, he had to take me home. i had a bad panic attack to the point i could not breathe and my whole body was all locked up joint wise. took him a bit to realized that i was not just trying to get him to let me stay and i needed help with it. he told me if i start making progress with myself that we can start seeing eachother again but i feel lost. my parents are so mad at me because i failed my relationship. they because very strict with me and are pushing me the exact way i told them it would not help. there is more but this is the just of what happened. i just need someone to listen and encourage me to do better.",Depression,477

well it's official, my guess was correct, i know this because i've been crying for no reason and i was like oh im just dramatic, then i started getting very irritable, then paranoid, and now i feel coked up. i hate it here idk what triggered it. 

is it possible that realllly good news could have triggered it? cause over springbreak i got the best news that the person who sexually assaulted me got suspended from the school. and i had like this burst of euphoria because i was so happy, i stayed up for two days because i had so much energy, but other than that i don't think i had any other symptoms. last week tuesday is when the random crying episodes began. my ex has been trying to take care of me because i would just ball for no reason and i was trying to figure out why, like i couldnt be alone or else i would start crying from anxiety and then on sunday i was so depressed i was staring off into space and wouldnt move or talk so my ex had to help me out of bed.

yesterday i had sugar and was like hm this is a suspisuous amount of energy. then today after i got a good critique from my proffesor i got filled with energy, then i ate food and drank water and now i have even more because when im manic and i eat or drink water it makes the mania worse. but like seriously could good news have caused this? 

over break i was also pretty inconsistant with meds but i was still taking them. like i think i missed one night dose (which i've done before and i've felt compleltly fine. i take 300mg total 200mg morning 100mg at night of lamictal, i was preparing for a depressive episode if i lost but now i'm having a mixed episode for the first time in a year which i was really happy about my winning streak against that and i havent been manic since like novemeber. 

anyways from the way i'm typing im like 100% sure that i am and it's just been getting worse throughout the day. i need to take some hydroxizine that typically takes me down from the euphoria. like i feel great but i hate feeling this happy and peppy and literally nausious from energy it's 3pm and i've eaten like four fried mozzarella sticks and that made me so stuffed.

"new here. a work related conundrum. i'm a male in my late 30s, struggling to find traction in terms of being able to support myself. recently, i've only lasted a few weeks in a couple of different environments, retail and warehouse. i could do the actual jobs well enough but i get tripped up socially, targeted by others, and quit as a consequence. 

i've had a difficult time throughout my adult years sustaining employment. there have been times where i had long term prospects but they ultimately ended badly. this has me in a pretty desperate mindset and i've decided to seek services for help finding something suitable.

what i want, ideally, is to have a space to work as independently as possible, with low social expectations and predictable responsibilities. i've been doing some gig work off and on, which meets those requirements, but that isn't a reliable income (and you burn through gas). 

my wife, who makes ok income, is being as patient and supportive as possible with me but we need a second income, especially with living costs skyrocketing. it's crucial that i maintain a job so that i can keep the marriage stable and avoid homelessness, which is what would likely happen if things fall apart. we don't have kids so at least that isn't an issue at stake.

i should add that i'd never qualify for disability benefits given my education and work history. 

what have others done to be able to support themselves, long term? what accommodations, if any, have you asked for in a job? and finally, has anyone significantly improved their self-image and ability to handle the bs at work?

"is my therapist at fault or am i being paranoid? f25. i've been seeing my m66 psychiatrist for the past 2 years and everything has been great. he's always been a very good professional and never made me feel uncomfortable. considering that i've known how he approaches therapy for 2 years now, i find it very strange that he has suddenly changed our boundaries - and without asking me. 

first thing, is that one day instead of a good bye handshake he said ""i'm going to hug you today"", and he did so. i didn't mind (goodbye hugging is very common in my culture) but i don't like that he didn't ask first if that was ok instead of just announcing it and going for it. 

he proceeded with doing this again after every session since then. then last time he kissed me on the cheek (also common and non-sexual way to say goodbye in my culture) but still strange as he's never done it before. he also called me once to check on me and ask how i was feeling (i had just lost my dad so maybe that's fine) but he's also never done that before all these years. 

today i cancelled our next appointment because something came up, and he said ok but i have to pay for it anyway, which i know some therapists do but 1) mine never does and 2) i cancelled way earlier than the timespan that would require me to pay. 

what is going on here? is this an approach i'm not aware of, is something wrong?

 so, time to inner reflect. back to finding me. it's actually kind nice being by myself, but it's when it stops being nice is when it gets to be a problem. wish me luck. ",Bipolar,114

i am now crying because my mil claimed that i had said several negative things about my husband (her son) last night and i honestly do not remember/recall me saying anything negative about him. i tried asking for specifics (maybe to help jog my memory) and she did not respond. i think the part that hurts a lot is her saying that i should be thankful that he got me and the kids through the past year and a half and doing the cooking cleaning and majority of the child care whereas most dads do not. i know this but to say basically that i am not doing enough for the kids or the family really hurts. she is supposed to be picking up the boys for me so i could have some me time but now i am feeling guilty about it. and angry and i feel like i have had enough. called the husband. he has suggested that i work on my project for an hour or so to calm me down. i am going to try that to see if it helps. anyway thank you for letting me vent. just when i thought i was doing better,Depression,200

what is it mean when two separate psych doctors agree that suicide is a valid option for you. one after working with me considered it for himself as well. the other said in a way she will not go to jail but still clear enough she thought it was probably the right choice.cuz no one i ever met really got a good defense then oh they should not say that well if they are willing to commute career sepuku and risk life imprisonments over it for someone they have a business relationship and otherwise fully stable and have decade plus time practitioning . they must know something no one risks their own career and life for something their soul is not ok with and not a stranger unless they know they are right or certain about their decision. i think we are so wrong about being so anti suicide because let us be honest. there is no real evidence its wrong that can stand logic even doctors know suicide is not wrong,Suicidal,172

"i might be dying, and my anxiety is going nuts i might have messed up yesterday. i'm an avid codeine user. i don't do hard drugs because i'm too scared of damaging my brain or other organs, but over the years, it has become increasingly difficult to lead a normal life without the help of a substance, considering that i have severe anxiety, depression, depersonalization, derealization and pure o. so i started to consume codeine once in a few weeks in order to be able to function correctly, since i've tried around 20 antidepressants and ssris and nothing worked for me.

yesterday, i took another dose. i buy otc pain relief pills which contain codeine phosphate but they also contain paracetamol (acetaminophen) and aspirin and, in order to stay safe, you need to do a cold water extraction in order to remove the acetaminophen and aspirin from the pills. opioids are highly soluble in water, so the codeine dissolves and the other ingredients  get filtered through a fabric and removed from the water, leaving a crystal-clear substance containing just codeine. however, i was in a hurry yesterday (stupid excuse to overlook my safety, i know) and i didn't wait long enough for the water to reach the right temperature (it needs to be around freezing temperature, but not frozen) and i did the extraction anyway. the water came out very milky and that is a sign that the extraction was not successful. i didn't know the water needs to be completely clear and i didn't look it up...i took the substance anyway.

a few hours later i did some reserch and found out that i might have potentially intested 4 grams of paracetamol and 5 grams or aspirin. 4 grams of paracetamol is a risky amount, because it can cause liver damage. the liver, then, continues to self-destruct over a period of 2 weeks (!!!) without showing any serious physical symptoms so there's no way to know whether i overdosed or not...it ultimately leads to necrosis and then painful, slow death. 

&amp;nbsp;

to preface, i'm 21, got diagnosed with bp1 in november of 2017, have been medicated since february 2018, and started going to a talk therapist last june. 
despite having experienced detrimental manic episodes within the past year (severing relationships, abruptly quitting a job i needed, etc) i can't help but think that i don't *actually* have bipolar. 
it's probably because the meds are working and helping, but regardless of that fact i can't shake it and start to convince myself that i don't really need them. 
in therapy i've learned a bunch about my habits and childhood issues, but we don't really discuss things through the lens of having bipolar specifically. 

my mind keeps coming to the conclusion that all of my actions in the past have come from a sound mind, and that i'm using mental illness as a scapegoat of some sort.. or something.

"stress and your body's endocannabinoid tone stress can be classified into three common categories:

* acute stress
* episodic acute stress
* chronic stress

&amp;#x200b;

**example of acute stress and your body's endocannabinoid tone:**

acute stress is a short term physiological response to a situation that could be a challenge or threat.

the sensation usually lasts for up to 30 minutes and the experience is usually linked to a one-off or infrequent occurrence.

for example, acute stress could include your body's reaction to:

* an approaching deadline
* completing a challenge or receiving an award
* narrowly avoiding being hit by a car
* rising on a rollercoaster or fairground ride

when your body responds to acute stress, it releases various hormones, including cortisol and epinephrine.

together cortisol and epinephrine prepare your body to respond to the danger by giving your muscles an immediate supply of glucose, narrowing blood vessels and increasing heart rate.

studies have found that endocannabinoid tone directly affects the level of cortisol and epinephrine and provides greater control over them during times of stress.

for example, people with a naturally high endocannabinoid tone experience a smaller heart rate increase during a stress response than those with a lower tone.

this is likely due to the endocannabinoids exerting a modulating influence over the release of hormones.

this was verified in 1993 when research scientists found that people with a medium or naturally high endocannabinoid tone secreted less cortisol.

this could indicate that people with a naturally high endocannabinoid have a less intense physiological response to acute stress.

&amp;#x200b;

"tips on finding employment after quitting job due to bp? this is all very hypothetical for myself, but i'm hoping others reading have insight. i am in the us.

i'm in a job that often triggers me for various reasons. i've been in a almost constant depressive episode for the past almost two months. the exception is some hours of natural ease/happiness from spending time with a few nonjudgmental friends throughout that time. my work performance has tanked and it's becoming an issue. i have coworkers talking to my boss about it, and i don't blame them, but my boss is trying to be nice about it to a degree that makes me worry that i'm taking his reputation.

i will be doing an out-patient treatment program in the next few weeks. i am already on intermittent fmla, but the current plan (which i do not like much) is to do part-time work in the afternoons at my current job while i do the program in the mornings.

i just had an anxiety attack after getting a phonecall from my boss to talk about it. i feel like the end is near, but my boss and a few coworkers are still trying to be on my side and i see that. however, i need to leave sooner or later. i used references to get this job (i've been in it for just under a year) that were absolutely glowing from people i respect. quitting is embarrassing for me and i wonder how much it will reflect on them. i don't feel comfortable using them as references any more. i have a long job history on my resume, with a new job about every three years. but i think it will look weird if i don't use anyone from those jobs as references.

my main question is:
assuming i don't have references, how do i find a job? 

i'm 30, i live alone because i have a hard time with roommates. i know i can be ""the problem,"" but i always try to resolve any conflict and the older i've gotten the better i've gotten, but i also am in a difficult place emotionally and am having a hard time focusing and functioning. i feel like i'm at the edge and yet there's a light at the end of the tunnel of treatment if i can just figure out how to do this job a little bit longer and find something else that can help me keep my home and continue my medications and therapy.

feels like a tall order.

"can abilify induce hypomania? tldr: is it the latuda or the abilify making me temporarily hypomanic at night?

long version: 
i've been on latuda for 3 years, with a 6 week break at the end of a pregnancy (to avoid neonatal withdrawal). latuda made me feel like shit, but i took it because it's the ""safest"" during pregnancy, according to 2 psychiatrists i talked to. it made me anxious, nauseous, and kind of caused a sundowning effect where i got depressed at night (i called it the ""night dreads"").

when i stopped taking it at the end of my pregnancy, i felt so much better, but i know i can't stay off medication. i started taking it again, but the side effects were so nasty that i couldn't deal with them with a newborn. 

my psychiatrist put me on abilify, but i have to cross titrate. i can't just stop the latuda. i'm down to 15 mg of latuda a day, and i'm taking 2.5 mg of abilify. 

i feel muuuuuch better during the day... more like my old self. however, my night dreads have gotten a lot more agitated and started feeling like a mild mixed state. so now i'm wondering which to blame - latuda, or abilify? the nausea accompanying it sure feels like latuda. 

i've been down to 15 mg of latuda for about a week. i'm debating dropping it completely tomorrow and taking the full 5 mg of abilify. i'm worried about mania... i have a 5 week old to think about. can i get some opinions? i'm loathe to give up the abilify, since i feel so much better during the day now. i have a psychiatrist appointment soon, but in the meantime, i'd like to hear what you guys think.",Bipolar,296

"worried about diagnosis i've been having some issues with my heart for the last 4 years (i'm turning 19 this year). by that i mean i'm having symptoms like heart palpitations, shortness of breath, pain in my chest / left arm / back and dizziness. 

every time i went to my cardiologist i was told i had mitral valve prolapse and that my symptoms were caused by anxiety. i wasn't given anything about my prolapse. however, the last time i went to my cardiologist she said that along with my mvp i also have a leakage on my pulmonary valve and  a distention of the aorta in the valsalva sinus (i'm actually trying to translate my doctor's note in english so there might be some mistakes). 

she said that i should avoid things like coffee and energy drinks and that i'm okay. she also said i must go for an exam every 2 years. she didn't really explain if my symptoms are solely from anxiety however.

that's actually why i'm writing this post to see if those other conditions beside mvp mentioned in my doctor's note are serious because i can't get it out of my mind these days. i've lately been experiencing dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain and heart palpitations and i can't figure out if these are caused by anxiety or something more serious.. i'm also worried about my aorta and the possibility of me having an aneurysm after reading the note.",Anxiety,245

i know why this is tho. because if they actually show interest in befriending me and they find me pleasant to be around i will get kinda overexcited and will be with them at all times, and sometimes that scares people away. it's either i avoid people like the plague or i get too attached. both is equally as bad tbh.

when i was in school i took gcse re and one of the topics we covered was about suicide and also assisted death. at time i thought suicide was bad because that is all we hear and are conditioned to believe. however in re we were looking into different religious beliefs and of course all the religions say suicide is bad but the teacher showed us a clip of a woman who was a suicide advocate and (id like to add i was not suicidal or depressed while at school) i thought she made some really good points. of course at the time i did not make my opinions known because everyone in class was saying how she is wrong i was only 15 at the time and did not want to be made to see some stupid school councillor or something so i kept my opinions to myself. everyone is argument against suicide in that class seemed so stupid to me after hearing what that suicidal woman had to say. i understand that when people die its sad. extremely sad when its a close friend or family. but dying is inevitable so why are non suicidal people so against suicide? id rather die on my own terms. i am extremely depressed and suicidal and i feel as though i get emotionally blackmailed to stay alive. i might sound naive but i rarely ever hear people telling non suicidal people to please stay alive. like when my dad was just randomly dying from a heart attack one day i did hear my mom say it to him but is she angry at him for dying even though she told him not to? no and that is because he had an illness which caused him to die. i also have an illness and that illness is depression which is pushing me closer to death just in this case its me wanting to die on my own terms? i know my mom would hold some sort of resentment towards me if i were to die by suicide. at the end of the day all deaths are sad and upsetting no matter how the individual dies so why are the people who are suicidal the ones who are selfish? so i have to stay alive and suffer just so you do not feel bad and get your feelings hurt? is that not selfish? what is the difference between dying by choosing suicide and dying naturally?,Suicidal,412

* **70%** of people with bd will deal with with 3 or more other mental disorders 
   
  * **75%** of people with bd will be deal an anxiety disorder

"help! overwhelming lust, and no idea if this is just soooo hot or if feelings are due to barely sleeping for weeks and brain being a mess we have been talking just over a week.

he wants to get me and basically have me live with him and be his domestic helper, which i love since that is my pesonalirt anyway. but i am also usually frigid have ptsd and dont feel things for people easily

but omg he is soooo hot and i feel the most ovrrpowering lust. my bidy hurts so much.

we have nothing in common, he almost exclusively talks about sex, is smart, a lawyer, but might be a sex addict but i kind of dont mind at all

then this other guy has entered my life who i hace tons more in common with

he hasnt sent a picture yet but if i was thinking rationally he would be someone i have real longterm potential with

but the other guy is so sexually forward and hotnand i cant resist him for some reason, he is like a vampire amd l want him to drink my blood .. not really but kind of if you get what i mean

i am somewhere with mold which means i have had insomnia for nearly a month

i should leave but i was helping a family with nine kids and they basically want my help so much and make me feel pressured so i cant go

the lawyer guy will pick me up and make me his and he is so hot and i need him so badly and i never have flings or do amythig like this but i cant control my desire help :(

the family here is not down for me to leave until end of month. and that is to go to another over protective family to see if xan sleep there.. but then they want me to come back. they sont believe me about the mold causing insomnnia but this happened to me in the past

this phone doesnt work well so sorry for all the typos

im just so full of burning desire and i already felt this way for another stranger a few weeks ago and poof it just faded practically overnight and i cant tell what is lust and what is genuine and maybe this is all just lust but is still genuine lust and i just sont hink i can resist it

he sent me a pic of his ex wife giving him a blowjob which i thought was kind of awful since that pic was meant to be private im sure

but im probably a masochist and like how dominant and narcissistic he is in an awful primal way

"sore gland in neck for six days, feeling so down with this anxiety. just need to vent. i've had this problem on and off for a while where it'll flare up for a few days and then go away for a while. i have no idea what triggers it. it's always the left side of my neck under my jaw. i'm assuming it's a lymph node, but i can't feel anything when i feel around in that area. but the pain is very localized to that one spot, when i press on it or turn my head it'll hurt right there. it also hurts when i swallow but not in a sore throat way, more like something is bumping against that inflammation and irritates it. 

i might go to the walk-in clinic today because i'm sick of worrying about it. i have no other symptoms besides a small headache between my eyebrows which started up about two days ago and has stayed pretty constant. it feels like a sinus headache but i don't have the other symptoms besides my typically slightly stuffy nose.

"possible misdiagnoses? during the winter of 2016 i was diagnosed with bipolar i, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, ptsd, and a few years earlier adhd. at first i felt that my diagnoses made sense and i was willing to take my meds. while there were times where i accidentally or deliberately didn't take them, i was mostly consistent. i did in fact feel better in time, though there were many ups and downs. the summer of 2017 i felt that my medications were working amazingly. i was productive, holding a job, writing a book, and overall happy. beginning my first year of college even started off well. towards the winter i became very overwhelmed but everyone was due to finals. i expected when our winter break came i would calm down. throughout the break i had very low energy and a few major mood swings. i convinced my boyfriend to go on a road trip to california with me in the span of a few hours. i felt very excited and couldn't stop talking and laughing. once we got there i was back to feeling depressed and unhappy, even more so because i thought going on a trip would help me feel better. i thought maybe the cold weather was what had me down, but the change to warm weather made no difference. when we got back in early january i took it upon myself to go off my meds cold turkey (which i know is not the best thing to do and i don't want to suggest that to anyone else). i expected my symptoms to worsen from withdrawals but nothing really happened. i was slightly more emotional and less zombie like, but nothing major. since then i've only been taking mydayis for adhd and i've felt a lot better than i have in the past five months. i've had relatively normal moods, getting sad when something saddening happens or vice versa. this leaves me extremely confused. is it possible that i don't have the things i was diagnosed with? or could my symptoms just be taking a break? i had extreme mood swings at the time of my diagnoses and even in the summer briefly. i really just want to know if anyone else has experienced this or has any thoughts.",Bipolar,383

"quick change in anxiety symptoms?! hi guys,

i've experienced anxiety for a long time now (26f), i'd say at least 8 years. symptoms have always been tight chest, heart going a million miles an hour, the occasional panic attack. 

i've always managed it quite well, have a decent job and can interact with people fairly well. 

i've never let it stop me doing anything as then i'd feel like it has beat me.

as of 3 weeks ago (it was literally one day fine and the next.. not fine!), i got on the train to go to work and felt like i was going to throw up. my mouth was watering and heart felt like it was in my throat. at first i thought it was food poisoning and something was physically amiss. 

even though i haven't thrown up and logic would indicate i'm not going to, it feels like i genuinely am on the verge everytime i am in a moving vehicle. 

i thought it would pass, but it's now just part of my everyday life and i'm finding it debilitating. i'm scared i'll lose my job because of it, which is feeding into the anxiety even more. the only way i can get through a train journey (or any moving vehicle for that matter) is by closing my eyes and putting on bob marley through my headphones. it's quite comedic but it genuinely is the only way i can slightly manage it. 

i've never enjoyed the commute and have done it for ages, but now it's became a thing. 

i have to have a plastic bag with me at all times as the urge to throw up is so real.

"so, i have a teenage brother who does not act his age but he is not sped or anything. i am about to turn 20 and he still wants to sleep with me. i feel uncomfortable sleeping with him (we both have our own beds) and i am in my mom's room since i am babysitting and he wants to sleep with me. i told him, you are not a little boy, go sleep in your room. i was told my depression was quite high and i tend to overreact sometimes but i just cannot control how i feel. i started crying from being upset and he still would not budge. my grandma said why i am so against it and i told her ""he mocks my depression every single time. you think i will feel comfortable sleeping with someone who mocks my depression?"" that is when both my grandma and aunt said ""it is all in your head. control your feelings. it is just a minor thing, no need to overreact""i know i am overreacting but its not something i can control. them saying ""its all in your head"" makes me believe that they are dismissing my depression as something small. i feel really hurt. i know i act childish but i just cannot control my feelings. it took a lot of courage for me to come out to say ""i have depression"" but i regret i ever did. they do not take my depression well. i attempted an overdose but they do not change their behavior towards me. why did i ever decide to trust them?? all i ever wanted from them was to say they love me and that they will support me and take my depression seriously. why is it that i feel that my doctor cares more than my family?? i really needed to rant so thank you guys for reading ""it is all in your head""",Depression,322

"update: i have a 2nd job interview tomorrow today was a heck of a day. i applied for this radio station job last week with the expectation that i would work part-time doing the news and some office work. it's not my ideal dream scenario but it's a job in radio, which i love more than anything else.

i walked into the interview today and knocked it out of the park. so much so that the owner is going a completely different direction with me. he offered me a morning drive show simulcast on two of their stations. they've never done a live, local show on this radio station. like...ever.

i wrote this in my initial post, but getting into radio was part of my therapy and mental well-being. the idea was that if i did something i loved that mentally/creatively stimulated me then i would be prone to having fewer episodes and just be in a better place overall.

this proved to mostly work. i was able to be creative to a point but i was still restricted by someone else's parameters. this new job would offer me the chance to build something from the ground up. it's giving me the opportunity to build my own brand. i've always looked at radio as a form of art and i've just been given a blank canvas. 

my wife didn't know how to handle me when i came home today. she hasn't seen me like this in over a year. my moods haven't really cycled; they've pretty much been low and lower. i feel higher than i've felt in a really long time. she couldn't stop smiling and hugging me.

"im 19 y/o and my hair is thinning and more worrying symptoms i first noticed my hair thinning two months ago. i've always had thick hair that would grow pretty quickly. now my hair's gotten thin and quite dry. the thinning is more extreme on the sides of my head with visible patches; at the top there arent any such patches (but still thinning and dryness).  i impulse-bought biotin tablets to help with the thinning, but im hesistant to take them at the moment since nothing's been diagosed yet.


but it's not just the hair. i have also been getting, although not frequent,  a tingling sensation in my right fingers,  and sometimes on a whole hand at times. 

more recently, say the last week or so, my vision's gotten blurry. i don't know if the  blurred vision is  permanent and i've just gotten use to it, or not, but ive definitely had these phases. 

ive looked up my 'symptoms' and what's come up are thyroid conditions, b12 deficiencies and a whole load more. with b12 deficiency in particular, its symptoms seem to align with mine pretty closely. other than my symptoms ive mentioned already, b12 deficiency symptoms include 'tiredness' and 'memory loss'- i feel like i have these, or atleast they're more pronounced recently (ive always been fairly forgetful).

"paxil withdrawal induced hypomania/rapid cycle i f**ed up my life in just 2 weeks.

my brief history:

* fall 2014 was prescribed paxil 20mg/day for mild depression, anxiety and hypochondria. 
* tapered from 20mg to 10mg in 6 month.
* i was on 10mg since june 2015 till august 2017. so: 2 years, 10mg daily. i always took medicine before go sleep.
* i tapered from 10mg/day to 2.5mg/day in 5-7 months (august 2017 ~ march 2018)
* i stopped to take medication 2 weeks ago (20 of march).

until this point i was totally fine. 

now detailed description of last 2 weeks:

* first 5 days were totally fine
* on day 6 (30 march) first withdrawals symptoms kicked in: shivering, cold, severe insomnia
* on day 12 (1 april) withdrawals was unbearable, experience first manic/depressive episode. decided to reinstate on 5mg(and later 10mg)/day. i took my first half pill midday.
* day 13 (2 april): 5mg morning, 5mg evening
* day 14 (3 april): 5mg morning, 0mg evening
* day 15 (4 april): 5mg morning, 5mg evening
* day 16 (today, 5 april): 5 mg morning

the symptoms i have now are rather painful and hardly bearable. most prominent are: rapid cycling from depressive episodes(+moredate agitation and anxiety) to hypomanic episodes and severe insomnia. cycles changing every few hours and quite intensive! i never had this before, never!! now i'm totally off, confused, suicidal, haven't slept cople nights. i'm in  hypomanic episode right now so i can write this post. i took sick leave at my work, but if this will continue i will lose my job completely. i beg you for advice on how i can stabilize now, based on what i've already done. i'm not even looking to weaning off meds now, as there are a lot of life circumstances now that i responsible for. i just want to stabilize and reduce pain.
what i can do at this point? it's do hard to believe i broke my brain beyond repair so rapidly, just in 2 weeks. i was normal, happy and fully of life. now i'm anxious, agitated and depress vegetable, lying on the coach wanting to die/suicide.
any advice highly appreciated.

p.s. yes, i visited my gp,  he put me on a waiting list to mental illness clinic (waiting time ~4 weeks) and advised to continue paroxetine 10mg/day for 2 weeks and then increase to 20mg/day if needed. but i'm scared to follow this advice",Bipolar,411

"psychiatrist told me not to google my medication, feeling weird about it starting this off by establishing that i am autistic, and one of my interests is self categorization. this can make me come across as a hypochondriac or doctor shopper, as i know my disorders/illnesses very well. once i started seeking treatment for my bipolar i learned everything there was to learn, joined communities such as this one, and started talking to others with bipolar.

as a result of this, i learned a lot about medication. not even really on purpose, learning about the meds people are on is just an inevitable of being in a group like this.

my psyche prescribed me abilify today, and out of curiosity i asked if that was the med known to sometimes lead to tardive dyskinesia. i'm not against trying abilify, all meds can have horrible side effects, but i wanted to know if that's what i was potentially getting myself into. i love my psyche, she's super nice and receptive, but she sorta laughed and told me to ""stop googling your medication"" which rubbed me the wrong way. it's a drug i'm unfamiliar with, should i not want to be prepared for the potential risks? i've told her before i'm open to trying anything, so it's not like i was telling her i wouldn't take it because i was scared, i was just asking a question so i know what to look out for.

i am on disability so don't work, live in a rural town so don't have a big social circle, and i used to get into a lot of different artsy projects, but since getting on my current med cocktail that actually seems to work, i've lost all drive and desire to be creative. i even pulled my art bag out in the hopes that i would want to pick things up and get messy...but nothing. i ended up putting it behind the end table in my living room so it is out of the way. 

i spend my days exercising, taking care of my dog, cat and husband, my house, cooking and watching tv/movies. and while i am a genuine cinephile - it's not enough; i feel so empty. nothing about my life feels worth while anymore. i can't tell my husband before i sort this feeling out because he'll take it personally and i cannot handle that kind of conflict right now. 


i literally cried myself to sleep last night (though that was provoked because right now my husband is sick with an infection for over a week and he can get a little brash when he doesn't feel well...i try not to take it personally, because it's not personal, it just can hit the right/wrong buttons). when i was showering today i was listening to music, and the song ""try"" came on, and when colbie caillat sang ""you don't have to try so hard"" i just lost it. there was no trigger this time except the song.

"chicken or the egg? discussion! hi everyone! 

i have a question that has been occupying my mind for a long time, and i hope that this will spark a discussion and we can get deeper into understanding bipolar and find some answers. maybe some of you are wondering the same.

the question: mostly during manic episodes when my mind is racing at an alarming pace i wonder if this is all caused after all by external factors that make me stressed out or by the bipolar itself, so from within. like, i'm starting to stress out because a situation occurs that is out of my control: turmoil in a relationship, some annoying interactions, things at work etc. or i start stressing out because of a shift towards manic?

 this is where i'm lost: at times i think that because of the diagnosis i overthink the stress and anxious feelings; knowing and convinced about my diagnosis i fully inserted bipolar behavior into my own identity and it informs my actions? but we don't live in a sterile bubble, life is life and always something is happening.


for context: 
during my manic state i start pacing, mind racing, increaced heart rate, twitches and intrusive thoughts. i start walking fast through streets almost running away from this, and i end up looking into passerbys eyes and then it's as if i'm being thrown into their lives, as if i live through their experience, i imagine how they act, what happened in their childhood, flashes into their daily routine, interactions, frustrations and happiness. and then i look at a window on some far away building, start imagining and experiencing the life of another person in a similar way.
 then i get thrown back into my body into reality and become more overwhelmed. then it's my own memories of the past, then imagining my own future and so on. 

 
the experience is intense and doesn't stop. when it wears off eventually i regain focus, calm and ability to think clearer. happens periodically about every few months and lasts usually about a week, maybe 2(depending how i deal with it after the peak. it's not the most intense that happened but i don't wanna go in even more details, because this is already tl;dr 

edit: i have been diagnosed by 4different doctors on 4 separate occasions, and rejected that idea for about 7 years until it became too unbearable and i was legit worried that this time i'm definitely not making it through. 


so let's discuss the initial question! would love to hear your thoughts about this chicken or the egg question and gain some insights!",Bipolar,440
"stressing about studying i am in my mid 30s and have just been given the chance to do an extra year and a half of study in a different university. the degree that i have was more theory based and i really need hands on experience to be employable in my field, which i now have the opportunity to do alongside guaranteed internships and portfolio work. 

my stress levels are currently through the roof about this, as i am worried that i won't be able to match the calibre of current high school leavers, who, even though treated as adults at university, still seem to have that high school mentality. my main issue is, even though not permanent, the dorm style accommodation and the fact that an ""old"" person is living with basically a teenager, although i did apply for a single room with a shared bathroom, so maybe not so bad. 

usually i wouldn't have a problem with this, but already having experienced this with not much success, i am now stressing immensely. i'm not there to be anybody's friend, but the way i have been treated in the past, just for being a little older has been disgusting. there is not much available accommodation at all in the country, so looking for anything else is currently out.

honestly, i think i'm just stressing because i'm over 30 and feel like i still don't have my life in order, with another future gap in my resume. 

please tell me i'm going to be ok.....",Stress,255

"my parents separated when i was 9 and since then everything went wrong. my childhood cat and my grandpa died a few months later. i felt sad almost everyday and cried almost every night. a year later i went in primary school and things got even worst. i started having social anxiety which made me miss a lot of my classes. i also had difficulties at my new school even tho i used to be quite good in my old school. i was 11 back then and thought a lot about suicide but i knew i still had hope for the future. because of my bad grades my parents took me to a specialised center to discover what was going on with my brain. we then discovered i was gifted which made me feel even worse about myself, as i could not understand why i had bad grades if i was supposed to have so much ease. my grades went extremely down and my mental health did too. i still had friends but life was not really good. my parents then tried to find solutions to that problem. i was disgusted of where i was living and wanted to start everything back from 0. so my parents and i thought it would be a good idea to move to another country that speaks another language ( do not ask me why even i do not know how stupid we were to choose that option ).i have then tried everything in that new country but nothing worked. after multiple years of sadness and stress i was officially diagnosed with severe depression and social anxiety by a psychiatrist. at that point i was not even going to school anymore and i started homeschooling which did not work because of my anxiety. we also tried medication for multiple months which made my depression even worst than before. i am now 16, doing nothing scholar. stressed, sad, angry and lonely with no friends, at thousand of kilometres of my dad. and i cannot find anything to do to stop that constant pain, other than killing myself. i have no more hope. i have almost lived longer in pain than happy.",Suicidal,366

"terrified of a brain ct scan i had sorry guys, long post but i just need to get this off my chest and i feel like i'm going crazy...
firstly, i'm a 23 y.o. male in relatively good health training and playing sports 4ish times a week.

so recently i was having a weird pain on the right side of my brain and ongoing pressure that didn't go away for about 4 days. eventually i went to the doctor who said we should do a 'scan' for reassurance to check if it was serious.

i stupidly just went along with radiology and did a brain ct scan when i could have asked for an mri. now days later i'm absolutely terrified of the affects of that ct radiation on my brain/body and so much regret i didn't speak up and demand an mri instead. i've been emailing the clinic and they said that on average a brain ct with the machine (siemens 64 slice perspective) they use gives 1 msv for a brain ct (i'm worried that this is just for a brain scan and that the person doing it would have hit my head among other body parts so the dosage might have been higher). 

i've now been reading about ionizing radiation for the past few days non-stop with occasional glimpses of hope about how overall the radiation impacted me is nominal compared to the background we receive. but then there are so many questions that stress me out, is receiving a large dose in one go the same as a 2/3 a year of exposure to the body? how much radiation can our bodies deal with? is there now mutated dna in my body that could cause problems in the future? am i more sensitive to radiation than a normal person?

i can't sleep properly and i spend my days distracted reading about the odds of contracting a fatal cancer because of a stupid ct scan i could have said no to. i just want some proof to say ""look, the radiation you received is minor and there is almost no risk with the ct"". i've read every resource there is (i think) and done every calculator i could and it still stresses me out. **this fear of cancer is partially because i lost my mother when i was quite young to lung cancer and i'm just terrified hereditary impact this has on me**

i'm trying to be very logical about this, but i'm struggling. i was in my room basically all night until i went to bed (at around 4 am), and never saw a bat, or heard anything against the screen, but just *knowing* that my window was open, and what if a bat got in while i wasn't looking or when i left the room or something? reasonably, i know a sick bat wouldn't be able to get back out if one had gotten in, and i don't think there's any way i *wouldn't* notice a bat flying around -- healthy or otherwise! -- but it's very hard to convince myself of that.",Anxiety,274

for the past 8 years now ive been battling some absolutely crippling health anxiety. after almost dying doing some drugs in college i really shouldnt have (k2/spice), i have been in constant fear that i am dying for one reason or another ever since.

 ive convinced myself i had heart failure and had multiple echos, ekgs, ultrasounds, etc of my heart done, all clear. the stress from all of that caused me to develop migraines really badly within the first year. those migraines caused me to convince myself i had an aneurysm or meningitis, so i had ct scans, mris, angeograms, a spinal tap, all came back clear and i was told it is just migraines. this has been going on for years and this past summer i spent a month in an inpatient facility for actually trying to kill myself over it.

now, after recently reading about a brain eating amoeba killing a woman in seattle for using a neti pot, ive been sleepless and at a 12/10 on the anxiety scale convinced ive got only a week left to live.

"muscle twitch around knee hey guys, only just discovered this subreddit today amidst another day of google searches - loved the ""health anxiety starter pack"" post!

&amp;#x200b;

i'm not sure what i'm asking for here, more just a bit of advise/guidance i guess.  i've always had some mild ha since my late teens and get abnormally anxious at the sign of any lump, bump or anomaly on my body.  like a lot of others, the illness that puts the fear of death in to me is als/mnd (from the uk).  i go through phases but over the past 6 or 7 years i've always tried to convince myself that i'm showing symptoms for it.  however, i'm 30 now and around 5 weeks ago i started to get a distinct muscle twitch just above my left knee (like lower right of the thigh).  it was fairly consistent, clearly visible but painless.  for context, i work in fairly stressful sales job, get a bit blue during christmas/new year in any case and had a lot to drink over the christmas period with numerous nights out etc.  this seemed to compound the issue and really flare up my ha.

&amp;#x200b;

since the turn of the year it's continued in the exact same location &amp; really seems to kick in when i pay attention to it.  however, when i play sports, workout and find myself away from my own thoughts it doesn't seem to impact me as much.  recently it's started to impact my sleep and my work which is quite rare for me and very concerning.  i've read in and around 200 google articles and i can't help but feel everyone of them can't discount the likes of ms &amp; als etc. i feel like the twitches have became a bit more regular but they're just as isolated.  i've been to a physio, they claimed it may be a circulation issue and basically battered my left thigh to help....it didn't.  i've been to the docs and given blood - they came back fine.  i've got a follow up with her on the 25th and my plan is get a referral to a neurologist....although that scares the shit out of me.  the doc did mention it was unlikely but to me that just translates to ""there's still a chance"".

&amp;#x200b;

i've tried to convince myself that this is stress induced and i'm in a viscous struggle - i'm trying to run more and improve times to prove to myself that my muscles aren't degrading &amp; are actually improving....although all this does is make runs far more stressful than they used to be!  i've became a right pain in the arse at home and my negative outlook is having a bit of impact at home with my fiance (also getting married this year).  

&amp;#x200b;

any guidance on how i should proceed with docs/consultants or any hints or tips to stem my worrying would be massively appreciated.

lobbed it hard, smashed in one throw.

living life became a chore.

but then i behaved like such a sod.
mania made me talk so loud,
but perhaps i shouldn't be so proud.

mania made me rather odd,
i told the others who'd wryly nod.
mania makes my mind a crowd,
i try to calm it with a shroud.

mania gave me a wild sex binge,
but surely after i did cringe.
mania made me accuse my friend,
i thought he stalked me hours on end.

mania made me search the garden,
made me accuse you - i beg your pardon.

suspect the government of grave ills.

"do you feel that you fit in here? or on reddit in general? i've been mostly lurking around here for many months now, and i'm constantly seeing posts that make me feel like i don't belong, or i'm an odd one out. like other people think and communicate in a certain way that's different from my own, or have an understanding of what avpd means that clashes with my own, or they have (fairly ordinary) life experiences or achievements that seem impossible for me.

i don't know how much of it is due to the condition itself (if avpd is even the right label for my specific brand of brokenness), and how much of it is due to objective differences related to the fairly unusual path i've taken through life.

also, reddit is regarded to have a kind of 'hive mind', where posters tend to express similar views in similar ways to the point where it's difficult to distinguish individuals. i see myself as an outsider looking at that from a distance, but do any of you see yourself as being a part of that?

if you don't feel you fit in, why is that, specifically? what details about you clash with what you perceive as the reddit or r/avpd culture(s)?

and if you do feel you fit in, especially on reddit in general, how does that relate to your avpd? is it easier to wear a metaphorical mask as a part of a collective, something like that? (that mask-wearing is something i see mentioned a lot here which makes me feel like i don't fit in, as i don't do it.)

i take a week of amoxicillin, on the 4th day i start getting a rash on my hands and feet which starts creeping up my limbs on the following days.  i call my dr who recommends that we switch to a different antibiotic (sorry, don't remember which one it was).  i take that for a week.  after the course is over i'm still coughing, mostly in the morning.

i go back to my dr who sends me for another chest x-ray which comes back with no indication of infection and then my dr sends me on to a respiratory medicine specialist.

respiratory medicine dr orders blood tests, chest ct scan and a breathing test.  blood tests have come back with borderline high levels of igm and i am freaking out about what this means.  no results from anything else yet.

so far i've been outside and that helps me but doesn't make it go away fully.

i went to eat at a restaurant and right when i walked it i got panicky and couldn't eat my food because i couldn't hold it down and i had to swallow the 2 bites i did take with water.

i know this is temporary and i plan to work out and get a therapist and maybe take meds but is there anything i can remember to know for next time?

it hasn't been a full week and i've had 2 panic attack and almost another.

i'm anxious about being anxious cause that will trigger a possible attack

panic attacks make it feel like i'm having a heart attack or anything life threating.

i should enjoy life but ik this is something that will take some time to deal with.

my hands shake a little and i still have a fast heart beat even when i don't feel panicky. it also feels like a pit in my stomach is waiting for a thought to pop up for me to panic.

when waking up today i panicked and walking it off reminded me of monday when i walking and had the panic attack.

anything i should know for next time?",Anxiety,298

"has ""tough love"" ever worked on any of you? my family is a very ""tough love"" type of family. as far back as i can remember, my parents and sister have tried to get me to change my bad ways/habits through ""tough love"", but all the problems they would try to use it for are still with me, so it clearly has never worked. just as an example of what i mean, my dad would give me ""tough love"" in the form of telling me no one would ever want to be my friend or hire me if i continued to be a fat slob (true). and the other week my sister came over to the apartment and told me that i wasn't being cute or quirky by almost never cleaning, i'm an adult and need to start acting like one, it is extremely embarrassing at this point, etc (also true). but even though i know these things are true, hearing people phrase it like ""hard truths"" i'm just too dense to grasp doesn't make me want to change for the better. it makes me want to go home, put a gun in my mouth, and pull the trigger because to my family i come off as such a complete moron that they need to tell me obvious shit i already know.

i am wondering if this type of ""tough love"" is actually helpful for anyone, especially people with avpd, because in my experience hearing people judge me like that just drives me to start spiraling down. it's like it really does solidify the fact that i am so worthless compared to actual human beings that they always have to talk down to me, and my relationship with others always has to be me getting scolded even well into my adult years. but everyone keeps touting ""tough love"" as if it's some magic cure-all that will make someone instantly snap out of whatever undesireable thing they're doing.",Personality disorder,327

"probably hypo after med change here i am at 6, after an hour of staring at the ceiling and trying not to move too much, after going to at 2:30 'cause i wasn't tired. this is all coming off the back of a month long depressive episode with a lot of suicidal contemplation, which was finally ended by an increase in seroquel to 300mg, an increase in lamictal to 100mg twice a day, and a decrease in lithium over the last few months from 900mg a day to 300. 

i have felt fantastic the last 4 or so days, but everyone around me is freaking out because i'm too hyper and loud and all over the place, especially  my gf, who's going through a rough patch. i can't even sit still long enough to comfort her and it's really freaking her out. of course the only other time i've been like this was right before i crashed and burned and went to the hospital for a week, so bad feelings all around i guess. 

it just seems odd that this would come about after an increase in seroquel and lamictal. if it stays too much longer i might drop a note for the psychiatrist, because i know this isn't sustainable, it just feels so damn good.

is this common to switch like this after a med change? also, how the hell do i deal with all the people freaking out thinking this is going to wind up putting me in the psych ward again?

"doing very well, but i feel guilty about recent events. any advice? hi everyone,

so i've been kicking life in the butt recently and i'm doing really well at work. i'm so proud of myself and i know that i have the energy to keep going and even push bad thoughts away.

to put the situation into context, when i was first diagnosed with bpd i took a lot of time off work sick. i then decided to leave and help myself get better. i rejoined my job back in feb and i think i surprised myself in thriving when i went back.

so i work in a call centre and if you know what its like working in one, you'll know that diseases and sickness are a minefield. on sunday night i came down with really bad flu and took monday off. my team leader was fine with it as they know that this is something that's going round and tbf i sounded awful on the phone. i've also decided to take today off too as i'm not feeling much better. 

i guess i'm feeling pretty guilty about it because i've never had an absence from work since i went back. i'm feeling a little paranoid and worried that my tl might think i'm slipping back into old bad habits of staying of work. i know this is pretty trivial but it means a lot to me that i've improved so much.

"coming to terms with anxiety as an adult, looking back it was pretty obvious and nobody talked about it. hi friends, new poster here. turns out my entire family suffers from anxiety, and nobody shared this with me. my mom was medicated for it briefly, my dad is medicated for it and also has ptsd, and it runs in both sides of the family. i figured it out in my early 20's and i have been seeing all these  things about myself in a new light ever since. currently suspicious that i might have ocd.

something i am frustrated with is that i had a lot of signs and symptoms, but was quieter than my siblings so it got brushed off all the time. in highschool i had one friend, and she was always telling me i was a worrywart, and openly mocked me about things i did. (for example, i could never just cross a street. had to be with the walk signal, and then i would run across it, and one day she made a big deal about it to my face)

nobody ever asked why. why i had almost no friends, why i didn't learn to drive until i was almost 30, why i am always going around giving people warnings about their safety. one time i had a complete breakdown after my parents got divorced, which was very rare for me. and my mom said ""she's just being dramatic and wants attention"" and that was the end of that. i was also ""the responsible one"". they just don't have time for my feelings.

i try to talk to my dad, who seems like the person who would understand the most, and i'll say ""i have been figuring out some stuff about driving and being anxious"" and he will go ""speaking of anxiety and driving, your sister has come along so far in her driving!"" or i will try to tell him i think i might have ocd and he will use this tone of disbelief and try to poke holes in what i'm saying to him.

sorry for the long post. i'm just grateful that sometimes i can find places on the internet to talk about it. i don't have the worst anxiety in the world, but it's always there, all the time. i appreciate that you folks are able to take it seriously. thank you for that.",Anxiety,402

i have 3 kids so my anxiety goes through the roof when things get messy.  i'm snappy to be around for my wife and my mother and i get into moods because everything in the house is messy again.  it's like a vicious circle.  my lows causes me to let the place get untidy and the mess causes me to spiral into worse moods.

but sometimes when i read what other people go through and mine doesn't seem so bad in comparison i start to doubt i even have bipolar.  these thoughts sneak into my head, i feel like an imposter and that i'm not really as bad as i think, and i'm only lazy, subconsciously tricking people and cheating by being on illness benefit.

"i have heard a lot over the years about people who have killed themselves while seemingly doing better. for example, ill use myself. i had a crash and burn in my life recently regarding losing my job because of my drug use, as has happened in the past, a really good job too mind you. and its only compounded my already existing problems with depression and daily suicidal ideation. however recently i have landed 2 jobs, one of which was a job i really wanted, so you would think i would be all smiles and optimism. and id be lying if i said i was not somewhat happier/more optimistic. but that is kind of exactly the point, i feel like i want to end my life right now as i sit here, while being on top. which let us be honest, my on top right now is still a molehill. i wanted to be on top of a mountain at this point in my life, or at least on my way to it. instead, in the swamp i wallow, not even possessing the desire to get out, unless you would count suicide as a way out. its still leagues further away than what i have wanted to accomplish with my life. so much guilt at myself over wasted years and opportunities. never joined the military. followed my pipe dreams of being a musician over everything else, and here i am. i take tremendous pleasure in discouraging people from their dreams, as i have had done to myself. anyway; tldr: even though i understood it before, i finally know how it feels to have your shitty luck/personal decisions make a turn for the better, and still want to kill yourself, if anything even more so, so you can go out while feeling somewhat happy and satisfied instead of bawling your eyes out, drunk as fuck with a gun in your mouth. i am not going to off myself right now, but id still really like to. feel free to disregard this post, i am not actively threatening death and that is more than can be said for most posts on this sub, so its more of an open journal entry than anything. later. the whole thing about going out while on top",Suicidal,381

the thing is, i don't have social anxiety in terms of not wanting to spend time with people at all... when it's about folks i know, like my colleagues and friends, i'm even more-than-average social.

however, i do notice that i'm... slow in social interactions. i mean that someone will say something and my brain shuts down and i can't answer properly in the moment. or i can't hear someone properly but i'm too afraid to ask them to repeat themselves (?!) so i just kinda freeze and/or act as if i heard what they said and the conversation goes on. then later i think of a ""correct"" reaction and can't for my life understand why i shut down during the convo and couldn't just think of this reaction then.

this happens with friends too, although it's more common with folks i'm not that comfortable with. is this an avpd thing or just a ""me thing""?

"on therapy my therapist is very talented.  in fact, she was booked for the entire month of december and for all but the last week of this month.  that means it'll be almost two months between appointments, when i'm used to seeing her twice a month.  this has never happened in our quite lengthy time together, and i'm scheduled through march from here on out.

therapy is an interesting thing for me.  because i come from a very traumatic background, therapy has been a godsend for ptsd-related issues.  what i'd never noticed before, though, is how much it helps me regulate my mood in between sessions.  knowing i'll have someone to help me sort through random thoughts and make sense of any major shifts or psychotic issues allows me to keep the jumble in the background.  it's like static; i can tolerate the static when i know there will eventually be someone who can help me understand how the radio works. (bad example but best i can do.)

my therapist, pdoc, and i constantly assess whether therapy is beneficial to me, because it has been ongoing for quite some time.  we were all of the understanding that, yes, in fact, i get a great deal of benefit from therapy.  now i'm one month into not having therapy, and things are falling absolutely apart.  suspicion confirmed.

"is it bad if your antidepressants makes you feel happy (i'm not talking about dangerous mood elevation)? i'm not talking about mania or hypomania here. but in the past i increased my escitalopram dose a few times. i was really ""climbing the ladder"" dose-wise (i think that i had to increase the dose over and over in order to keep the ""happy"" effect going) so i had to quit and come back down to the proper dose. i felt unbelievably great as i increased the dose. i took notes on my experience and i was just saying how great i felt and how i had nice memories of my family and my past...my mood was just great.

antidepressants have been in use for a while now so i'm sure there's some wisdom about (1) whether being happy like that is sustainable, (2) whether it's healthy or not, and (3) whether i could've actually ended that phenomenon of chasing the effect up the ""dose ladder"" and gotten the effect to ""stick"".

most importantly, when the ""happy"" effect was in place all my adhd medications were working. this was absolutely life-changing. i can read in my notes that it says over and over ""if i could only maintain this level of healthy brain-functioning and adhd-medication effectiveness then i would have a great life"". i wonder if there's anything to be learned from this whole experience that i had with the escitalopram and the adhd medications; maybe the experience can provide a clue as to what to try in order to have a sustainable foundation for my adhd medications.

i do have some anxiety/depression/ocd; i don't think that it's at the clinical level. i mean, i looked up the criteria for ocd and one of them said something about the issues taking up an hour of your time each day, so i'm far from that. and when it comes to depression and anxiety, it's a situation where i have mild issues where you could probably say that it's unhealthy for me to have the negative tilt to my emotions that i have...again it's nothing clinical, though.",Anxiety,353

"psychosis triggerd by bodytherapy hi guys,

i have had a psychotic episode 2x. in between my recovering fases i noticed that massage therapy was a trigger for me too sliding back and loosing it. after i noticed it the second time i called up some masseuse therapists and came to find out: they have a contra-indication for massages. meaning they dont do massage therapy on people who have psychiatric problems. the reason being that massaging the body does something to the mind. it can release emotions that are ""stuck"" in your body and these emotions can trigger you.

that was really a bummer for me because whenever i was stressed and needed relaxation i would take a massage.

i have been looking into things like: meditation, reiki, breath therapy and bio energetica. but often their is a contra -indication.

i wanted to know if any of you also feel their is a body mind connection? and that things that happen to your body can be a trigger. would love to hear experiences. i would do anything to stay stable &amp; healthy. but i need to find a way how to cope with stress and how to relax my body in a way it wont be triggered.",Bipolar,206

"anxiety and weed hi, looking for a bit of advice and experiences from r/anxiety here.

around christmas i started to develop some kind of anxiety disorder and had a lot of panic attacks. for most of my life i've always been a little anxious and tended to overthink, but these symptoms were just much worse. up to this point i've also been smoking weed, but not excessively, mostly once a week. after developing said disorder, weed now increases my symptoms, despite it never doing something like this before and it mostly calming me down. even when i had a greenout, i mainly suffered physical symptoms. 

in response to my symptoms i started with autogenic training, a lot of introspection about my fears and stopped smoking for about a month. with this i got the worst of it under control. since then i've been smoking a few times with mixed results, sometimes i get more anxious and panicky, but on other occasions it also felt like a normal high. 

right now i still have some lingering symptoms that can be better or worse, depending on the day, so i'll definitely quit weed until i can resolve this. my question now is, if any of you here have suffered something similar and were you eventually able to smoke without getting anxious again? i'll be honest, i quit enjoyed being high, so that would be quite the bummer, but certainly not the end of the world.

"i am going to rant. what i want in life is to be loved as deeply as i think i love. and i do not know if i will ever get it, only because i am selfish and i am always going to want more. or one day i am get it and it will be unhealthy for me. but i want to arrive at the end of my life someday and think about how much i have loved and how much i have been loved. i want people to be sad and i want people to remember me, not for what happened when i was there, but the emotional hole that i have left on their life. like even now i fantasize about dating a girl, or making friends with a guy, and being so close to that person that when i leave, or am pushed away, they will always remember me because of whatever effect i had on them. and i want them to be sad about it. i think that is as best as i am going to be able to describe it. i feel like i am constantly holding on for dear life on a cliff and my grip is about to run out. there is just a constant strain to do anything. there is just a pull in the back of my head constantly weighing me down, so i am constantly feeling that and thinking about that, but then everything else just happens. things have just been happening and i have just been there to experience it. like i cleaned up most of my yard untill i got tired, then i did the kitchen, then i did the back yard. i do not think i made that much of a decision to do those things but they happened. cutting myself too. i only recently figured out that i am doing that so that i have the scar and i can see it. and it sounds dumb saying because why else would you do it. but i just have been. i have always focused on the quality of my cuts so that way they leave a scar but. everyday feels like a one note day, and no matter what happens, or what connection i make with people, it resets the next day and i forget. that is another foggy thing i think. spend a very busy day at the carnival with friendsx go home and sleep, wake up and only have four real things that i can remember from that night. and i do not know if that is everyone and i should stop expecting more or not. like everything is underwhelming and i want more. and not matter what i do nothing changes and idk. scary :/ how do i function",Depression,466

"lamictal withdrawal experiences hi there.  i've been trying to find out about people's experiences getting off lamictal.  i've been on a road getting off meds for a while now, with the doc's approval.  i got off some clonazepam and then moved on to lamictal.  as i mentioned, i've gotten off things before, but this last one really has me freaked out.  it's been 5 weeks, and i'm still exhausted.  it's not every day, but most days, and i get dizzy still.  it just seems with everything else that i've gotten off of, that given some time, you have a slope effect of things generally getting better over time.  this is the first time where if it is the withdrawals, it doesn't seem to be getting better (as quickly as i would think) and kind of getting worse.  

i'm looking into other things, such as lyme (which actually could be a possibility) but was wondering if anyone else had a case of a longer withdrawal time with lamictal, or something that you thought was harder than you might have thought in the first place?  or just any thoughts?  it's really dragging me down.  i'd really appreciate it, and hope that everyone is feeling well!

"stress ate and now i feel really poorly. anyone have tips on soothing the aches and nausea? **just in case anyone needs a tw, there is talk of medication**

**and in advance i'm sorry for any spelling errors**

&amp;#x200b;

wasnt feeling well at all and started stress eating. i tried my stratergies that i do with my psychologist but today was just one of those days if you get what i mean.

i've eaten too much, but a majority of what i've eaten is sugar which also gives me headaches when i eat a lot of it (also in case this is needed information; i dont get sugar high).

idk if i can take nurofen or panadol (panadol is a paracetamol i think, and i think nurofe contains ibprofen) for the headache because i'm on ritalin (methylphenidate) and movox (fluvoxamine, i think its called something else in america though and most people on reddit seem to be from the us) and idk if some pain killers are compatable with ritalin or movox.

im also on a birth control to manage my periods (its called ""evalyn"", i think im spelling it right, idk the science medication name off the top of my head though) but i know i can take pain killers with my bc. however it does cause mild indigestion. i though it'd be good to include this because the intestines and stomach are connected lol. 

the queasy feeling is really bothering me and i feel sickly. does anyone have any tips on what i can do to ease it? ive drank lots of water (both for the stomach ache/ queasiness and for the headache) and have my big water bottle next to me in case i need more, but it hasnt helped. just looking at anything food related is making me feel like im gonna throw up too. i've thought of sleeping it off but i struggle to nap during the day and i've already slept in a ton this morning so my body doesnt feel sleepy at all, i've tried putting asmr on too but that isnt making me sleepy.

would really appreciate if anyone knows how to help this. i might try looking more into wether i can safely take some pain killers or not (using reliable sources so that i can make sure i'll be safe)

i'm also gonna ask on a medical related subreddit if i can take ritalin and movox with pain killers at the same time because it's really hard to find information online on my own.

"take that seroquel semiconscious thoughts at 4:00 am on seroquel are unintelligible. memories are photographs, they lie horizontally and twist and float across a black screen and cannot be intelligibly linked to the jumble of words that come to my mind when i try narrate what is happening to myself. i want to panic for fear i've lost control of my conscious self, my own perception of my own experiences and my own story. but what is more likely? do i have a story over which to have control? aren't i a random smattering of continuously altered star manufactured material - simply an unlikely accident which happens to be consumed with its own importance.  why does it make sense to believe that my very own particular microspeck of cosmic trash that happens to exist at this time in this place fits into some narrative that makes sense to try to tell? perhaps a failed seroquel dream is simply a more accurate reflection of being. and that's how i narrative myself back into a story of a legitimate human experience with a basic grasp of high school science. take that serorquel.

"getting really hyperactive when 'manic'? let me first say i'm not officially diagnosed with bipolar and idk if i'm posting on the right place, i'm diagnosed with several things but mainly bpd. psych says i likely have fast cycling bipolar type 1 and i guess i'm not diagnosed because she's focusing on my bpd first. i've had a really destructive psychotic manic/mixed(?) phase that made me drop out and get hospitalized last year

i don't know whether i should be calling this manic, since i don't know whether its from bpd or my possible bipolar. but when i get manic i get extremely hyperactive next to the usual mania symptoms, my friend just asked if i was on cocaine. i talk like crazy, constantly shaking, twitchy. its so weird. i'm just sitting here in front of my desk, legs shaking, eyes barely blinking. i feel so amazing yet scared, i'm about to go run to maybe calm down and get some weed

i've had these moods for years. usually these moods last from about a day to 2 weeks. they probably last longer, but turn more into an irritated mood. i am medicated, i'm on seroquel and while it helps me a lot it doesn't get rid of this. sorry if this post is all over the place, i'm really not thinking straight",Bipolar,223

"so...i feel unsure about posting this because i am not sure if it is too good to be true... or maybe people will not believe me. but i think i am going to be ok and i want to share what i think really, finally worked. i have major depressive disorder, generalised anxiety disorder and c-ptsd from years of childhood sexualising abuse and violence. i drink too much, i hate myself. i have always had issues with needing an outside substance to numb that pain. drugs, booze, sex.... you know how it goes. the last few months have beeny worst. i constantly thought about offing myself.last december i contacted a clinical hypnotherapist about help to cut down my drinking. i connected with her instantly. we spoke about why i drank and my past came up...as it does when you have seen a many health professionals as i have and are used to going through the motions. she talked to me about a process called the richards trauma process (trtp). it is 3 sessions. session 1: stop self sabotagesession 2: address and leave behind the traumasession 3: set yourself up for the future. it does not retraumatize you. i have done emdr, cbt and years of talk therapy and they all retraumatise. who wants to go through those events again??i did not do anything about it until 4 weeks ago because it cost $1200 and i had quit my job. but i was finally in a position to do it.between sessions 1 and 3 i have gone from severe depression, severe anxiety and moderate stress to zero depression, zero anxiety and severe stress. we figured out the stress was due to my new overwhelming desire to take care of myself and being a mother of very young children... that is quite hard. so session 3 we spent on managing parental overwhelm. tonight my kids were little shits and i did not care. i was fine. i did not snap. i did not cry. i did not descend into a panic attack like i have so many times before. i waited for them, then we did puzzles and listened to music. oh...and i went for a run this morning for the first time in months! i do not even know myself and it is insane to think about. who even am i without trauma and mental illness. i think of my abuser and he seems insignificant. i look back on my trauma and it evokes no physical reaction. no knot in the stomach. no chest tightness. no heaviness in my body. it is as if i am looking into someone else's life. not my own. i hope this helps someone. it has brought me back to life. trtp - holy shit.",Depression,459

"feeling like a creep in public/on public transport so i've had this for a long time, but only now have i sort of grasped why i feel like this.

whenever i'm outside, and especially in closed off public transport like the subway, i'll feel like a creep because i just stare and analyze everyone and everything. the reality is that, when i get anxious i get hyperaware of everything and everyone around me, and when i start starting at strangers, analyzing every bit of their appearance/clothing/posture/etc, i start feeling like a creep. only recently have i realized that the being hyperaware is where the feeling of being a creep comes from, vs just organically. with me being less anxious lately, i'm more able to just stare off into the distance and distract myself with my thoughts, and then suddenly i don't feel so inadequate/weird anymore.

i know i've thought about this before, and even said it to someone that when my anxiety takes over i literally can't think of anything but the present situation. i'll literally start brainstorming ideas to think about so i can distract myself from what's in my face that second.

"(idk what subreddit to put this in, so i decided to put it in here)why is it that when someone admits that they may have a bad characteristic, people admire it? they are impressed that someone can admit to having a weakness. such as being too sensitive, or too inconsiderate, too myopic, too loud, too shy, etc. in general people are impressed that others can admit a weakness about themselves. people admire that you can admit fault and be able to constructively criticize yourself.now, once you start talking about physical attributes such as being too skinny, or too fat, or not good looking enough its becomes a matter of self esteem. not a matter of constructive self criticism, its now that you are insecure. they tell you that you need to think better of yourself. that your looks do not define you. ""work on your self esteem"" or ""you sound insecure"". why cannot i just peacefully say or admit that i am not good looking? or that i am not in anyway physically attractive? why does that make me insecure acknowledging a fact about myself? i know and i am reminded everyday. i can see how i am treated differently as opposed to conventionally attractive people. i know that i have never been liked romantically by anyone. why cannot people accept that instead of invalidating me and saying i am too negative or that i am just *insecure*?i am not asking for pity or for validation. i just stated a fact that i have observed about myself. if it makes you uncomfortable so be it. but you would be fine if i admitted that i was not outspoken, or a good problem solver right? i would not be insecure, i would just be someone who wants to be better. i am not insecure, i am also not blind. i see myself in the mirror everyday. pretending that i am attractive is not going to change anything. so stop. insecurities",Depression,329

"health anxiety effects english is not my first language so apologies for any grammar mistakes. so i've been having health anxiety, mostly due to the apparition of a dark spot in my stomach, and some sores in my scalp. initially i didn't worry about it, but it started spreading, and i was convinced that it was some cancer tumor. that coupled with upset stomach made me live day after day with anxiety about my health. it's been two months with this anxiety, i've been to the doctor and he said i have a healthy stomach, besides my colon being upset and having a infection. i'm on medication for that. been to two different dermatologist for the spot in my chest, said it was dermatitis and got medication for it. still, i'm anxious about my health, and been feeling dizzy lately. i been coping with my parents divorce, economic issues and think i might have depression. what are the effects of health anxiety? think it might be worsening my health",Anxiety,169

"my new insurance considers my meds ""preventative"" so i thought this was interesting and also maybe a little sign of attitudes towards mental health changing.  i got new insurance and was looking through the list of ""preventative"" medications, the ones covered at 100% and don't cost you anything, to see if anything i was taking was on the list.  (it never is, but always worth a check.)

first i searched depakote.  to my surprise it was listed, but as an epilepsy medication.  my first thought was whether or not they knew i wouldn't be taking it for epilepsy and i would get away with getting it for free!

next i searched for cymbalta, and it was there!  listed as an antidepressant.  in fact they had nearly all your antidepressants on there.  lithium is on the list and even some anti anxiety meds.

sure enough, when i filled my prescriptions, they were free.

i mean it makes good business sense.  i am more expensive if i end up in the hospital.  just like quitting smoking drugs are frequently covered because you're a lower risk if you quit.

for some reason it just made me feel good.  like hey, it's just an illness and we know you need meds to keep it under control.  no big deal.  or something.  it also made me very people for everyone under this plan because while i do not currently have any issues paying for my meds, i know what it's like to be in that position and it's horrible.  it's nice to know everyone i work with who needs this kind of medication can get it and maybe this is a new trend we will start seeing with insurance companies like smoking cessation drugs.  fingers crossed.",Bipolar,291

i see no point in pursuing another relationship. why go through the pain all over again? why get my hopes up just to be crushed and thrown away like the trash i am? i'm not hung up on him. i fucking hate him, he was a horrible piece of shit and our relationship was toxic as fuck. but that was our thing. lord knows i'm not the best person either.

"bipolar w/ asmr (sidenote on new age culture &amp; spirituality) anyone else experiences asmr on top of your manic episodes? i have type 1 asmr and bipolar 1 and i've found it to be a deadly combination. when manic, i'll come up with these metaphysical laws and--despite how compulsive and irrational as fuck they are--  get this huge flood of stimulation from the back of my head all the way to my feet that makes it seem like the universe is confirming my understanding. it got to a point in my development where i believed i was given the date of the end of the world and that the afterlife was split 80% enslaved and 20% saved. 

months later, my life has blown into ruins and what was once seeming so inexplicably clear now seems psychotic. is there a lesson to be had from all of this or can it all be written off as manic thinking? 

sidenote: what's extra complicating on top of all of this is the thirst that new age culture seems to have on pondering spirituality and metaphysics. on the one hand, it's nice that there is a community (albeit niche) that embraces neurodivergence and ""out of the box"" thinking. on the other, i'm finding it dangerous because of the community's willingness to affirm these manic thoughts that im having as reality. the twofold affirmation had me push towards accepting all these thoughts as absolute truths and burning bridges with people that wouldn't accept what i was experiencing. this ended up being a lot of fucking people and i ended up homeless.

ok i've made posts about things i've felt before but somehow everything i had 2 weeks ago is now gone and has been replaced by new fears.

i'll get straight to it, here are symptoms with context:

- odd feeling on left side of body, mainly legs, only when laying or sitting. feels like weakness but i can still walk just fine and feel no difference in balance. sort of like fatigue without any actual excercise to cause it, really odd and it scares me.

- tinnitus, already diagnosed 2 years ago with bilateral tinnitus and it's got easier to deal with. but in times like these it makes me feel awful. i'm aware of the recent progresses in tinnitus treatment so it doesn't worry me too much as it's benign and only sounds when i'm in silence.

- constipation, probably caused by the stress or anxiety. either way it might be causing me problems.

- intermittent sharp stomach pains on the left side of my abdomen under ribs, i called the doctor about it and he said it was nothing lethal or worrying but to get it checked out anyway. that my current worst fear, that i had a digestive infection caused by the constipation. 

- a feeling that for some reason, i'm going to die tomorrow from some lethal random attack of sorts, like my intestines will rupture from a tiny stomach pain, or that i'll have a heart attack because i can sometimes hear pounding in my head. that's the worst of all of this, the never being able to relax, i feel on edge 24/7. researching everything that i can in order to reassure myself, only to find an even worse disease that vaguely correlates to my symptoms.

i always feel the urge to check my speech to see if it's slurred, or check my heartrate to check for palpitations, or check my typing to check for stroke/als. i seriously can't keep living like this, why do i keep getting these physical symptoms?!

:last night, i had a weird sensation in the left side of my head, above the ear. it felt like something was throbbing or pulsating inside my head. it was never painful and it would go away for a few minutes before coming back. i felt it until i went to sleep (where i thought something was going to happen to me in the middle of the night or i would die in my sleep.)


it doesn't help that right now, my current paranoia is a brain tumor or a unruptured aneurysm. earlier this week i had a headache above my left eye around my eyebrow but that went away after a few hours. i've been incredibly anxious about that side of my head.


i woke up this morning and haven't felt it again, though i've been a nervous wreck all day fearing it would return. it hasn't so far, but i think i'm having hypersensitivity in that region cause it feels a bit fuzzy right now.

"looking for some good vibes hello everyone, i am writing this because i've been reading posts on this sub for the past week, since i've learned about avpd from my new therapist and researching about this disorder, as i believe i also suffer from it and have a curiosity from you people.

unfortunately, not to make anyone feel bad about it, as i know this condition is very hard to live with, but i have been trying to look for some success stories from people here, or maybe just some nuggets of hope from people that have managed to peacefully live this life.

so my question for you, especially maybe for the older people here with the condition,or the ones that have managed to get married or with any other kind of ""success"", no matter how small, what is your outlook on life? what advice do you have regarding managing this condition?

although i've also had a rough couple of days, i'd like to believe that not all is bleak and that getting access to good stories from people similar to you can certainly help.

please share anything you'd like that might help me and others on this sub.",Personality disorder,199

"swollen lymph node, goes away as fast as it inflames \*\*repost from askdocs

as far as i remember, this began this past summer. one of my armpits would get a painful feeling, almost as if i pulled a muscle or so, but no lump or anything. then a couple of days later, it would be painful and a lump and what i figure to be a lymph node. it's never more than 1 inflamed at a time under 1 armpit. it used to be just the left, but this morning i woke up with one under my right. i would say the frequency is about 1 flare up every 2 to 4 weeks, moreso on the side of a month. and no bigger than a pea, or maybe m&amp;m. i can't really tell since i touch it, but sometimes the skin appears reddish underneath, sometimes it doesn't. they eventually go down again and no pain and it feels fine. i don't ever have any symptoms of being sick, as in cough, fever, chills, etc. everything is pretty normal beside the lymph node (if it is that) flaring up. so, something more serious to worry about and go see my pc or just let it be? could they be cysts that flare up and then go back down? it's not the same lump either, the location changes too. i do have history of healthy anxiety (my fear is lymphoma) and i've been to the doc plenty of times this past year already and would rather not for something like this, especially when it goes away.

"how many meds have you tried? sometimes i feel like it's a merry go round. i've been on so many that i've lost count. off the top of my head lithium, ambien, trazadone, risperdal, depakote, temazepam, seroquel, perphenazine, zoloft, abilify, wellbutrin, currently on latuda. i'm sure there's others but just don't remember them. i've had side effects from the majority of them. 

lithium destroyed my thyroid and caused me to gain weight rapidly, risperdal made me incredibly stiff in the mornings where it was hard to get out of bed, zoloft made me yawn for zero reason constantly, seroquel made me aggressive and hard to wake up.

so far latuda has been pretty good no side effects that i can think of other than the gagging when i saw the retail price.",Bipolar,132

"not sure if i'm having health anxiety or if there's something seriously wrong with me and doctors won't listen i've been growing more and more anxious and i stumbled across this subreddit through related searches. basically, i keep getting the sense that i'm not well, ""off"" if you will, or that there's something worse wrong with me than all of the doctors i've seen are making it out to be. and just to be clear, i haven't gone to the doctor about random things that turn out to be nothing--it's always for strep-like symptoms, colds, or throat infections. i've had three in the past two or three months (doctors just say maybe you need your tonsils out or might be a carrier for strep), but at the same time i've lost around 10 pounds... i thought this was over the course of the summer but looking at my last medical visits i've gone from 135 (feb 2018), to 130 (oct 2018), which is normal weight fluctuation for me, but then from 130 to 125 (nov 2018) and then my most recent visit (jan 2019) for my third throat infection my weight was 121 pounds. i'm a 5'4 woman and i keep telling the doctors about my concerns (different doctors too) but none of them seem really concerned. is this normal?? they suggested maybe i was eating better, which might be true, but i really haven't consciously changed my eating habits and idk if i'm eating more or less than usual because i've never thought about it that hard... can anyone help me?? should i chill out?? should i see another doctor, and what would i say to get them to take me seriously? this is causing me a lot of stress and i feel okayish but i'm uncomfortable with the amount of weight loss i'm experiencing and it only seems to be getting worse.",Anxiety,314

"mania-like episode, how do i bring this up to my psychiatrist? so i have not been dx'd with bipolar. i do have the following formal diagnoses as of now: borderline personality disorder (bpd), double depression (major depression and dysthymia), generalized anxiety, bulimia, alcohol abuse.

i'm trying to figure out how to present this to my psychiatrist. i think i've been in a manic episode for the last 2-3 weeks or so especially. i had started thinking this on saturday and my significant other said he thought i seemed like i was manic for the last few weeks.

my psych doc put me on 20 mg of prozac which i initially thought was making me really zombie like but then i went on a tinder spree. i have promiscuous tendencies when drinking but i usually don't actually do anything. i hit on an old boyfriend once, but otherwise have been faithful to my so.

in the past month, i have had sex with 3 different guys and had a multi hookup with one that i've basically been texting nonstop. i've been pounding energy drinks and alcohol, and tindering, and wanting to go out and do things and talk to people and dance which is weird for me because i'm introverted. 

my so confronted me friday night/saturday and everything kind of crashed back and i'm having a what the fuck did i do moment.

i felt good last week. i actually felt like i had some energy despite still not sleeping any better than usual (i have bad insomnia). that never happens, and i want to cry because if it is actually bipolar, i'm not going to get to feel like that again. my psychiatrist thinks my baseline is a depressed mood (which i'm now in again). so basically i get to spend the rest of my life depressed and i don't want to have to live like that.

how do i bring this up to my doctor? i have been drinking a lot, so i'm worried she is going to dismiss it as a by product of that instead of something else. i've taken mood stabilizers in the past without much improvement in the depression, but the focus was on the depression. i'm assuming my doctor has ruled out bipolar already.

is it weird that i would have a full blown manic episode for the first time at 26?",Bipolar,398
"alternative to propranolol? hello all! i have a history of asthma and propranolol can cause bronchospasms.

i had given up. i was already thinking of the worst case situation and let's be honest, kinda freaking out. i'm just posting this because i want to give hope to anyone who is in the same situation and i want to remind all of you to freak it *if* the worst comes to pass, not *in case* the worst comes to pass. anxiety is a bitch, and i'll probably struggle with it for the rest of my life, but i can also choose to counter my anxiety with rational, positive thoughts. i can re-frame the situation. i don't need to be a slave to my own worst case thinking.

now i am constantly thinking of suicide. i tried to smother myself with a pillow, twice. i figured it wouldn't work, but gave it a go. then i tried to see if i could get a gun from amazon - spoiler alert... no you can't -. 

i was in so much mental anguish i self harmed the ""typical"" way... but that wasn't enough. i wanted to break my hand. i needed to. for three days over and over i've been beating it with a hammer. yesterday it was as swollen as a half a golf ball. 

i haven't told anyone. i don't trust anyone. i don't want to go to the hospital again. i tried calling my therapist, but she only works 2 days a week. i'm afraid to call my doc. i don't want to waste his time, or for him to think i am just trying to get attention or something. i don't know what to do. i'm desperate for help, but i don't trust anyone. 

i've tried sooooo many treatments. last month i finished a round of 25 ect with ketamine sessions. i've gone through all the drugs. nothing helps. nothing will ever help. i just want to be put out. and i 100% do not want to go sit in the stupid hospital. that would make 6 months in a row.

"some context: i have suffered from mdd and gad for a couple decades now, tried over a dozen different treatments with no long-term success. i have also had several sui attempts in the past, two of which lead to fibrilation and being revived in an er. i have been in and out of psych hospitals too, and receive the multi-thousand after it which did not help me at all. after all, debt is part of my problem and costing that much also just worsens my problem. i have not been able to hold jobs for longer than a few weeks with one exception for a program that helps disabled people. anyhow, usually at work i ended up having catatonic episodes, panic attacks, and such too frequently for any employer to keep me around. i seem to do well in school, that is if i am able to complete a semester before a panic or my mental health leads me to drop out mid-semester(has happened several times). my intelligence seems to be the only thing going for me, but my job prospects would only be there if i can get a degree really, and formal education does not seem to work even though i get straight as in times where i finish a semester. but i am 26 and my formal education is only an associate's degree and who knows if i will ever get far enough in a reasonable amount of time? then, in addition to these issues with me, the world is honestly hopeless. wealthy elites screw over the rest of us, gaining exorbitant amounts of wealth during the pandemic while everyone else is struggling. not to mention the rise in hate groups, f'ed up police, climate change, and i do not know a single person who has not suffered abuse of some kind(which seems to indicate humanity is also f'ed up). i mean, there is a myriad of things i bring up that is incredibly disheartening about the world, but i do not wish to make this rant much longer. so, pretty much the only things keeping me alive are 1) i do not want another multi-thousand dollar bill my parents have to foot from hospitals in case my suicide attempts fails again, and 2) i do not want to ruin their lives by losing me. but they are fairly old baby boomers, so i suspect it will not be long before they die. hint: the only two things keeping me alive would no longer be true in that scenario. guess what i would do in that situation?, honestly, the only things keeping from sui are my parents",Suicidal,440

my first born is due in two months. farming season is about to start. constantly awake until 3-4 am reeling about the real possibility of financial ruin due to the costs of having a child and the current state of the agricultural industry. the thought of changing careers only amplifies my anxiety x1000. that's the worst part, being unable to sleep. sometimes i'll start to go asleep and the slightest noise will wake me up, or i'll just wake up in a full blown panic. i've been spending all day either being a nervous wreck and if i'm not outwardly nervous, my body is still showing physical symptoms of it. almost like it's subconscious. sometimes i feel like the anxiety itself is scarier than the situation i worry myself sick over. my other new trigger is every little ache, pain or cough i get i spend the entire day spiraling down a hole thinking i'm obviously dying and i won't be there to see my daughter's first steps and the farm that's been in my family for 5 generations will be sold because nobody will be there to take care of it.

"i am worried i actually don't want to get better hi everyone,

i have been seeing the same therapist for almost two months now. while i think we are working well together, i am getting the feeling that i am repeating myself every session. 

i just can't help but overthink my whole life. this tends to obsessively question my career, constant negative self talk, and occasional suicidal ideation (although i could never take action, so its mostly more self torture).  i'm eating maybe 1 to 2 meals a day, inconsistently showering, never doing laundry, and so lethargic that i mostly just lay down and watch tv/youtube whenever i get home from work. i don't take walks, i don't try to think positively, i don't really exercise, i don't practice gratefulness, etc etc. i feel like a loser, but the thing is...i don't make any effort to change or feel better.

my therapist keeps clearly telling me this rumination is simply not beneficial. i know this is true, but it feels impossible to stop. i can't feel better without taking action (again, total agreement with my therapist), but taking action is so hard. its getting to the point where i am thinking i am comfy in my misery. i no longer have hypomanic phases thanks to medication, but at least when i was hypomanic i was putting in effort to better myself. this nonstop depression is so consistent, i am beginning to hypothesize that its not really depression, but me continuously self sabotaging myself and always blaming it on something external.

can anyone relate? would you say this is just more negative rumination or overthinking? if not, how does one shake the refusal to take action for their own sake?",Bipolar,289
"my meds make it so much worse i was diagnosed with bipolar two 3 or so years ago and it's awful. i am always depressed unless i'm hypomanic, which doesn't happen very often. i miss being super happy when i'm manic because it's a lot better than the depression. i am on lamictal and latuda right now, and the latuda is ruining my life. i think about suicide everyday to make myself feel better, but i know that's not an option because i can't hurt my family. i have akathesia from the latuda and i also have this feeling like i'm not a person. i don't want to hang out with my friends or anyone anymore and i'm always stressed out and depressed. i'm slowly getting off of the latuda since it is ruining any happiness i could possibly have but each day that goes by i want to kill myself even more. 

if anyone has any advice for me that'd be great because i can't seem to find anything that makes me feel better. ",Bipolar,175

"(xpost from /r/bipolar)weird experience with latuda monotherapy? advice? throwaway account cause i don't really use reddit, i just needed some advice

i was diagnosed with bipolar 2 about a month ago and started taking latuda about 20 days ago. the initial 20mg dosage gradually killed my (at the time) current hypomanic episode within a week, which was fantastic! i also noticed some, but not all, depressive feelings being held at bay, which was nice, if not quite optimal.

however, i bumped up to 30mg about a week ago, and 2 days after that, i had a psychotic episode until the next morning-i felt incredibly debilitating dissociative symptoms and i felt like my body was acting seperately from my mind in a way that was trying to kill me. i couldnt really talk, and mentally, i felt completely void and couldnt form a coherent thought. (my experience was a lot like that of this blog post: https://blogs.psychcentral.com/bipolar-mom/2012/03/i-had-a-medication-induced-psychotic-episode/). since i have bp2, mania with that much cognitive and physical impairment isn't really normal for me.

anyways, after that experience my psychiatrist recommended that i cut back to 20mg latuda (which seemed to help with hypomania to some degree) until the end of the college semester, and we planned to experiment with med cocktails after the summer. with all this in mind, i'd like to have some sort of plan going forward. is there a safe way i can continue to ramp up my latuda dose (i.e. in conjunction with a stronger antimanic agent like lithium)? or should i quit latuda and try a different drug entirely?",Bipolar,264

i don't do this often enough though. i avoid him because i don't have much to give. kids in general make me feel uneasy because they need so much from their caretakers, i feel inadequate that i can't give them that. he reminds me of myself when i was younger and it makes me uncomfortable, because i rejected that part myself a long time ago..

kids are authentically themselves, until society molds them. i can already see it happening with him. he's quieter than he used to be. he doesn't look people in the eyes. he shuffles nervously. he stutters. he hides. all things i used to do when i began rejecting myself. i still do these things. my authentic self is locked away, she's still there, but shes completely hidden.

i follow the little brother who is 16 on instagram and we occasionally interact (liking stories, pics,etc). yesterday i remembered that my friends and i created a 'burner' account 3 years ago that we used to look and follow people we didn't know (crazy i know). 

&amp;#x200b;

anyways, i noticed that jake was following this burner. i looked at his profile as saw a bunch of stuff posted that i have never seen before. it was typical teenage boy stuff like rap music, middle fingers in pictures, etc. but nothing that i haven't seen before. i realized that i was blocked from viewing these stories and unblocked whenever he posted other stuff. i instantly started to feel sick and uneasy at the thought him blocking and unblocking me each time. i even felt a little teary. i thought, does he think i am uncool? old? did he think i was going to tell his mom? i also post things with cursing etc. so i really felt confused. i know in reality it is really not that deep because i too have older adults in my life 'blocked' from viewing my story but the feeling i felt was uncontrollable. 

i don't want to feel like this anymore. i have felt similar to this in other occasions and another user asked if i had rejection sensitive dysphoria. i am not sure if i do.

my initial fear was that i was pregnant... 3 negative test results later + even having my period, i still doubt myself -- what if that wasnt a period? what if the pain ive been feeling on the lower side is actually a baby?

though maybe... the lower pain is from the constipation and how im having trouble with my digestive system (i...really want to, for the lack of a better term, poop now) maybe high levels of stress can cause that? someone please enlighten me. haha

"" i knew i had anxiety but ever since i choose what i wanted to do math is now associated with anxiety"" to make it worse i was labeled a troubled kid when i was younger in life so as a result we moved a lot, and i never had a long friendship making me easy targets for people who love drama. so as i was growing i was taking speical classes since i had bad adhd aswell, so i wasn't getting the right credited for really anything in life and was basically  labelled a special needs since they never put time into me. as a result i started trying better and finally was able to upgrade to college level everything in grade 10 keep and keep in mind i was in high school in grade 8 due to this special program, and now they they teach me like any other kid. i've found it very hard to do anything since i grew up getting 1-1 attention, now since high school math is broken and 50% u will most likely never use in real life depending  on the career  you pick although the one i wanted to get into was ""money related"" i most diffidently don't need trig, etc anyways     "" i really need help finding out how to coop with anxiety, this only happens during math aswell, so i know the trigger, and i know hen i clam myself down and i'm very happy before math i do better during math. but for some reason anytime my teacher ignores me for example today "" i rasied my hand to kep my practice quiz checked nobody else had their hand up"" so i wait she see's says one second and goes to 5 different people none of them had their hands out and forgot that i eveen asked so i promptly left teh class and went outside to get air or i was gonna start crying for the stress, angry anxiety and everything why are my emotions 10x whenever i'm in math  is their even any way to fix this issue?""",Anxiety,434

"ill preface this by saying: i have seen numerous psychiatrists, therapists, g.p.s, and have been through the wringer with my family doctor throwing anti-depressant/anti-anxiolytic prescriptions at me to see what sticks. everything still feels the same no matter what med, new routine, holistic solution, etc. i am exhausted of living. so, in march of 2020, i attempted suicide. i lived alone in a nice apartment; i locked the door to my suite, flipped the security latch, taped a handwritten dnr sign in my living room, locked the door, and i took an uncountable amount of clobazam (not clonazepam, different drug), 100 gravol pills, and at least 50 nighttime benadryl pills. i got into bed and listened to strict machine by goldfrapp. then, a feeling id never felt before i was done. i felt like id finished life. it was so soothing. it also could have been the effects of the massive quantity of pills i took. my then-girlfriend called me, and we have a fine conversation. this is where i black out. she tells me days after my failed suicide attempt what happened. i was completely coherent, and then just stopped talking. this is when i passed out. long story short (too late), i wake up two days later in intensive care. tube in my throat to regulate breathing. catheter definitely in. guess my dnr did not work. my parents (who live four hours away) are sitting around me as i come to. fast forward, i convince everyone i am not crazy and they say maybe you should go to our psych ward and i said no, i will get better care when i move back to the city. (i was living in a small city at the time). i get back to my apartment. my parents stay with me. covid breaks out. a post-grad program i am studying announces that classes are over. i move back to the big city in my parents basement. my degree is mailed to me. i keep having the same conversations with people. i keep doing the wrong things. i continue to comply with the ministry of transportation to get my drivers license back. they keep sending me different forms to get my doctor to sign. my depression/anxiety stays the same. covid has made the world weird for years just days after my suicide attempt. am in purgatory? so much violence, greed, and narcissism in the world like i have never seen before. every day i work my jobs, but money just comes and goes if id never even made anything. same conversations, ad nauseam. am in hell? am i in sartres no exit? most days, i think i am in purgatory. am i in purgatory? am i in purgatory?

"am i a hypochondriac? i am a 24 year old female, and would like to preface this by saying that i do actually have a few chronic illnesses that have been diagnosed, one of which is an autoimmune deficiency. as well as severe anxiety with frequent panic attacks. 

 that being said, for years now i have been hyper focused on various symptoms my body has displayed that usually end with them disappearing and me forgetting they ever happened.  but with every pain or nausea episode i have, i end up spending hours googling symptoms and what they mean.  for years now i have put in anywhere from 2-8 hours a day on various medical websites. 

this week alone i have convinced myself that i have:
-ibs
-crohn's
-breast cancer
-kidney failure
-pregnacy
-kidney stones
-patellafemoral syndrome
-worms
-diabetic ketoacidosis
-an impending heart attack

so my fiance and i found a mouse in our room and kept it in a box for a bit because we had just had a bad snowstorm and don't want to put it out there and have it freeze. we've been packing because we're about to move and so we've been kicking stuff up, but haven't found any droppings. of course after we caught the mouse there were droppings in the box. 
anyway, now about a week and a half later, i have heavy chest pressure, a dry cough, and back pain in the area of pleurisy. i went to medemerge last night and my blood pressure was 98/65, pretty low, but the doctor kept saying how great it was. i was diagnosed with a upper respiratory infection, but she also gave me an antibiotic because my tonsils were pretty big.

i am 15, and for the past years i have experienced extreme fatigue, to the point where i sleep ~15+ hours a day when i can. but how do i know if this is real? i could just have a bad lifestyle. i try my best to stay healthy and do everything the doctor says, but it doesn't go away. 

i also believe i could be ""faking"" it? i experience a lot of weakness and like...memory problems. i also get chronic pain in my thigh which is really painful. but the thing is...there is nothing that could cause this? i don't think there is. it is incredibly random - am i making this up to seem like something is wrong? 

i have previously been diagnosed with depression and gad, but i got those treated. but i am still worrying about this? i am on medications that have helped, so why am i still anxious over my health? they worked for everything else :( i think it is something in my mind because i keep getting ""dreams"" that make me feel no one can be trusted, or that i will be yelled at or do something wrong. 

how do i even know if i'm suffering from health anxiety? what if i am just exaggerating everything? maybe i am just a person who is afraid to grow up, or that i am immature...

i am really sorry if this broke any rules, or didn't make sense. i guess it was just an outlet! i have been scared for a while now. thank you for reading, if you have any advice on something i could maybe do to help calm my nerves, i would appreciate it very much :(",Anxiety,346
