"minimal success for 8 months hi! i'm headed into work, so going to just get this out fast in hopes someone can give me advice.

i have been at home for almost 4 years with mostly depression, some hypo mania, and one scary manic episode brought on by an antidepressant. i also have extreme anxiety and adhd.

i started lithium in august and was able to help my husband at work within a month. i came out of my shell, began to make eye contact, conversation, and was hired on as an administrative assistant. my career was teaching, but i know i can not be that person anymore. 

i have struggled the whole time, but was managing okay enough to continue. i am not okay again. work is stressful in an unreasonable way and i can feel myself crashing. i am terrified of becoming the hermit i was for 4 years. i was hospitalized last march wanting to die from so much empty. i need to keep a purpose.

anxiety is almost unbearable and the empty, i can't do it anymore feeling is taking over. music and tv feels fake and every task is a huge effort. these are some of my signs. i am back to needing ativan to function most days and adderal the others. how can i prevent a full crash? help!

current meds:
lithium 600mg at night
ativan a couple times a week and increasing 
adderal when i am paralyzed several days a week.
i just added 500 mg magnesium glycinate and vit d3.

your stress sources

your restrained characteristics
""finds satisfaction in sexual activity, but is emotionally detached which prevents him from becoming too involved.""

his confidence is low but he is unable to admit that is the reason for his avoidance of conflict. feels it is a situation out of his control and he is making the best of it.

his arrogance causes him to take offense quickly. only those closest to him know deep down he is sensitive and sentimental.

""he is able to find satisfaction through sexual activity, but can be restless and emotionally distant so he never really gets too involved with others.""

your desired objective
""feels as if he has been held back from many things, and that other things have always tried to dominate him. he now feels he has to make up for lost time by living an overly intense lifestyle.""

""feeling tension and stress brought on by situations which are out of his control, leaves him feeling helpless, anxious, and in adequate. he escapes the situation by throwing himself into new activities and insisting he get his own way. appears to be in control of himself, which he isn't, leading to outbursts of anger.""

"so i lead a pretty lonely life i am going to, i work and play video games and go to the gym. this is all i do with my life everyday and it has been feeling pointless and repetitive and i feel like i am stuck in a loop. i do not have an outgoing personality and i prefer to be alone, maybe because i am used to it and have become addicted to the thought of being alone and not needing anyone to rely on. i do not find anything interesting besides the things i listed above, i do like some activities like going to the movies or going on a hike but would feel weird with doing these activities alone so i find myself just sitting at home all day and repeating my same actions. i am complaining about this lifestyle but also am not doing anything to stop it. i understand i can change it by being more social and going out but i do not think its as simple as that , its almost as if i cannot even though technically i can. i do not have any friends and even if i do social activities with my family i still feel very alone. pretty much what i am asking is, is there anyone out there who relates to how i feel or if they did how did they get out of this feeling. this all started my freshman year of high school when i was 14, i am now 20 and i feel it has been the same. i had a girlfriend for almost 2 years but that did not work out obviously that is why i am here lol, i tried dating apps as well and it has not been working, i am tall and i like to think i am attractive ? not that it matters but yea i just would like to solve my issue as it is only getting worse. just wanted you to get a good perspective on my life and if there is anything wrong with me. just want to rant and see if anyone feels the same",Suicidal,359

"disability with bipolar disorder i have a general question about being bipolar in the work place. i was diagnosed with bipolar type ii about a year ago and i currently have a job but am looking for a new position. while filling out my apps there is a mandatory question where they ask if you have an kind of disability and bipolar disorder is on the list. i'm very hesitant about identifying myself with a disability. i was able to stay on my dad's insurance with a letter from my doctor but i'm not sure what applies for this. i'm really nervous about letting any of my employers know i am bipolar. i'm pretty good at hiding my illness but i have depressive dips that last for a few months and they affect my work. i'm on medication but currently i've been having hormonal issues that i'm dealing with my gyno. i get very antisocial and irritable but i am afraid of my work trying to get rid of me if they knew. i know they technically they're not allowed to but i work in the biotech industry and they can be very cutthroat. i don't want to not be hired for a job if i was upfront with being bipolar. i also do value my privacy and i don't want the whole world knowing about my illness. i was hoping someone out there has been dealing with this issue and can offer some advice.

"story about the time my teacher made me stand up to show my red face to show the class when i was emmbaressed so it was my biology class and it was one of those classes where i had none of freinds in and was extremely uncomfortable every lesson because alot of the time we were made to answer questions infront of the class or have to find partners and obviously me being awkward and with social anxiety i never j never had a partner.

and because of this i always would get a red face from embarrasment and i guess she took notice because the time we we learning about why the face goes red she decided to ask me a question about it knowing my face would go red and once it did she said ""oh look it's happening now"" which obviously made it 10x worse and she littarly made me stand up and face the class it was one of the worst days of my school life.

but, this past week? everything feels like it fell apart. my sister popped over with her husband on a surprise visit ( haven't seen her in 14 years ) so it should've been exciting, but all it did was bring trouble to our already fragile household. she instigated drama with my father and everyone else, then her boyfriend was just causing problems with zero consequences. then, two days later, my uncle shows up and it's all great.. up until he hits me with news tonight that he's got cancer and he's trying to enjoy himself since he's scared of worse case scenario. all of this on top of family dilemmas with my father, seeing it affect my grandmother? all tied together with the very awkward sleep i get, i can just feel my mental health regressing back to incredibly old, toxic, unhealthy ways. i wanna smoke weed to ignore the stress and call off work, but i know doing all that will ruin any progress i've ever made.

"like really, are you going to tell someone who is depressed to ""stop with the siege mentality and move on with life""? sure, you may be depressed also with the current sh\*t show of how the upper echelons are handling this pandemic and the never-ending lockdown that takes a toll on people's mental health, but telling others with your hard love will not help anybody.plus, stop telling me to seek professional help. your intention may be helpful, but i am done with the ""so-called"" mental health professionals or therapists who were being unempathetic. i hate spending my hard-earned cash on seeking professional help, only to get my mental health worse (been caught by this once), and being in a country where religion is omnipresent, are you going to see a professional advising you on religious stuff instead of supposedly helping you personally? i have been super duper wary with seeing another professional after my first experience seeing an unempathetic one ever since.also, if you are in the good, you do not need to brag that what you did was working for you. sure, yeah, good for you that it works, but stop expecting others to be on the same page as you too, no matter how good the intention is. again, be empathetic. if that person does not want to do what you did, just do not force him or her further with your intentions, can you?by the very least, can people be more empathetic? everyone is dealing hard with the current situation right now, but if you are in the good (or even not so good), you do not need to be an a\*\*. being empathetic really means a lot for many, including myself. even a simple video call that cheers up each other would mean a lot, i have to admit.i am sorry if my words are all over the place. my mental health is not in a good mode, but if anyone's struggling, let us support each other... the lack of empathy by many people in my country is just astonishing",Depression,344

its been one thing after another in terms of bad things happening that i have to deal with. between serious injuries to myself, high periods of emotional stress helping others through the darkest times of their lives, and high levels of stress with things that keep happening at work i can't keep up. yesterday i cracked. i stayed in bed all day alternating between crying and feeling emotionally detached. today was much the same. i'm just now feeling like i can bear to get out of bed and do anything. i have a therapy appointment set up. but it feels like i'm back to being that sad teenager with no way out. my coping mechanisms aren't working the way i need them too. any advice to get me through this time is appreciated. thank you, and much love to this community",Depression,239

"before anything i should say i have been diagnosed with adhd, anxiety, and depression, and i am on meds that finally work for my adhd. so about 2 months ago i switched from 15mg lexapro to 35.5mg venlafaxine (effexor xr) then 70mg venlafaxine abt a month ago. before i had been on lexapro i was on prozac and noticed a huge improvement with both anxiety and depression symptoms when i switched. however i started to notice how tired the lexapro made me and that started feeding into a worse and worse depression. so i talked to my psychiatrist and we talked about either going on zoloft or tryibg snris. i told her i wanted to try snris because i saw a lot of people say it helps with energy and other physician symptoms of depression that i had been experiencing. but after a couple of months of being on this i have noticed how much worse my anxiety is. i knew it would be pretty bad in the first few weeks of switching and bumping up but this is lasting way longer. i now feel like i have tried so many different meds that nothing will work. will i have to choose to either be really depressed or really anxious? if anyones been in this boat please lmk lexapro to venlafaxine",Depression,221

he then went on about how i don't really have anxiety, because if i do have anxiety, i would have found a way, apparently he knows because he has anxiety too. the thing is, i don't have anxiety. avoidant personality disorder is different from anxiety.   he then said i'm just making excuses and i just got lazy. 

i'm not asking them for second chances, i know right from the start they are not gonna accept me anymore, but i don't appreciate them making fun of my shitty mental health. that's the thing with this disorder, we literally avoid things to the point where it affects our whole life. 

he was acting like i went to his office crying and kneeling down begging to give me a second chance, he said ""i know why you came here, to ask for a second chance"", when i literally just sat in front on his desk and agreed that they can't give me another chance. i wouldn't have come if i knew he was gonna make fun of my disorder. i only came because my teacher said it needed to come from him for it to be final. now everyone thinks i'm just making shit up. it also doesn't help that my country doesn't have a ged.

"back to the psychiatrist... i sat in the parking lot outside of work today and finally made another appointment with my psychiatrist after three months of quitting medication. i'm so tired of feeling depressed and *angry* and nauseous and paranoid. i'm in a mixed episode and my method of keeping my head down and waiting it out isn't working well for me.

music sounds strange. voices and lights are overwhelming. road rage spills out of me and i'm horrified but unable to stop...and when i'm not behind the wheel my feet drag, i have trouble focusing, every small task a huge ordeal. i haven't cooked in weeks -- i'm either overeating or not eating at all -- and i'm spending way too much money on delivery and drive-thru's. i'm anxious and irritable and bitter and hopeless and yet i know, logically, that i have no reason to feel this way.

i was on medication for six months before i stopped taking everything cold turkey. the lamotragine and wellbutrin had helped a lot at first when i was in a similar state last spring, but i wasn't convinced that i needed them anymore (or that my bipolar diagnosis was even accurate) and i was a couple of weeks away from losing my insurance indefinitely.

it's been a whirlwind of a winter. i went through it all:

euphoric hypomania around the holidays. huge spending, not sleeping or eating, hanging out with everybody, falling in love, lots of drinking and partying and being merry. i could so easily sink karaoke in front of hundreds of my coworkers at the holiday party or confess my love for my best friend or *be curiously spontaneous*. 

followed by a crash. depression. self medicating. waking up with a feeling of dread. not wanting to leave the house, go to work, get out of bed. i quit my food industry job, stopped hanging out with friends, stopped replying to texts and calls.

started feeling better for a week or two before *bam* here we are. mixed episode.

i'm not looking forward to tomorrow. i don't want to be on medication or accept that i have bipolar, but i'm willing to try if it gets me out of this horribly distressing mess. i don't know where to start except to post here and not be in the dark about what i've been going through these past few months (as well as the past decade). and i'm fortunate to have a wonderful psychiatrist. it helps with going back.

"years of living on survival mode? its been tough on you, no one shares your feelings or feel your pain, you are all alone, and the world is only pushing you to the edge every single day, you are tired, just want to sleep to forget, to get out of the reality that surrounds you, no matter how many times you try to take your mind off of your trauma, your agony or your numbness. the poisonous what if hunts you every moment, the why and the why me. waking up at night, thinking if all this been a dream, this cannot happen to me, i am not where i am, takes you a minutes to realize your reality, to put yourself to sleep every night wishing not to wake up again, then you remember that one person that you do not want hurt by leaving, or the people that their existence and well-being depends on your presence. you have tried everything, you avoided everyone, maybe even forced yourself to laugh and smile to give those around you the fake sign that you are alright, you know you hurt many, close ones and strangers, just because you do not have the ability to deal with emotions or events, sometimes you think how to make it up to countless of people when you get out of this reality, dreaming of better times where you can make yourself and others safe and happy. let us stop the time, now , cry if you can, its okay to cry, let some tears wash a little of your agony, pray if you believe in praying, there is no single path to healing , but i know healing will come, for me and for you, you will look at those days with silence, no regret, nothing but emptiness. you will find what you been struggling for without effort, sometimes the universe like to play with us by making the path of simple things difficult when we mix our desire with fear, amplifies all the negativity into events, but that is enough for now. just want to tell you that i am cheering for you, and we will be alright. from the heart to the heart",Depression,370

i get minor panic attacks on random moments and i can not seem to find any reason why.  
the most recent example is when i was asked to go on a team meeting outside of working hours. i felt almost frightened and felt like i wanted to cry and life is too overwhelming for me. another example is a party i recently went to, i was scared to go for about two weeks (even though my gf and a friend were with me). there was literally nothing bad about it, but i was stressed up until the moment i got there.

when i try to think of a reason why i'm feeling like that, i do not have a single clue. my life is good and i have everything i need/want but i keep looking for small things that make me feel unhappy and anxious. i can stay awake and panic/overthink over all kinds of small things like this. i just want to feel happy and stop overthinking constantly but i do not know how to do that. sometimes i think it will get better when i'll get older (25y right now). but the negative feelings are taking over more frequently and  i am ready to start working on it  so i can actually enjoy life. any advice?",Stress,266

"i have never been one to identify with suicide or anything like that but time and again this week the thought has really been pushing itself on me. i do not want to carry on anymore. i woke up this morning and my first instinct was to go back to bed, this is following around a 4 day period when i have not left my bed. my life has just fallen apart recently and not for the first time. i am intensely sensitive to rejection and that in turn makes people reject me as i scramble to make small things better my actions get desperate and it pushes people away.here is where my life currently is. my house mates are being toxic as all hell. they have forced me to move out and in the waiting period they have ignored me or been vocally dismissive of me when i am in there presents. going as far as to invite a full party of people i know over and then getting angry when i wanted to come in and talk to them. when i have tried to get in touch with these people they have clearly been turned against me so i do not really have any friends at the minute.i lost my job a few days after they asked me to move out so on top of having no income i also need to move back in with my parents who while being nice, they are very negative people who want to spend all the time complaining, they also have a life style that brings trouble to the house quite a lot so it leads to me having to have to be out numbed in physical confutations (when i hate violence) or helping a sibling out of a suicide attempt (two examples of real things that happened on my life 2 month period of living with them).this girl i was seeing and getting very coupley with, the first girl i have had romantic interests towards in over 3 years has called it off because she is confused. i have accepted it but she is a very flirty person (which is fine its the person i fell for), and at social events she is very over the top with people which i was always fine with but i can tell it now makes her feel uncomfortable acting herself in the situations around me. she now seems uncomfortable when i make any comment that other peoples would be fine and she actively avoids me unless its just the two of us.no friends, no job, no partner, no prospects to improve any of the situations and make to feel uncomfortable everywhere i go. its not the first time my life has fallen apart like this. and people wonder why my confidence has dropped so much over the last few years. my first instinct is to go back to bed",Depression,486
"anyone else here with ha who works in a biomedical/disease-related field? hi everyone! this community is a great support on days i'm feeling bad, and i've had this question on my mind for awhile. 

i've struggled with anxiety my entire life, officially diagnosed w/ gad when i turned 13, and have been on meds/in therapy since. one component of my anxiety is bouts of severe hypochondria that wax and wane as far as i can remember (my earliest memory of this is crying to my mom because i was terrified of having cancer and dying - i was 7). 

while i was terrified of diseases, i was also fascinated by them. i remember watching mystery diagnosis episodes when i was in middle school (which, while super cool to me when watching, would result in me later being terrified by whatever disease the episode featured). when i began seeing a therapist and psychiatrist, i got very interested in mental illness, and later that led me to an interest in neurological disease in high school, which, eventually, as it turned out, morphed into my career. 

(very) long-story-short, i ended up getting my undergraduate degree in neuroscience, and am now a 1st-year phd student in molecular biology, where i study protein misfolding in neurodegenerative diseases. for someone who spent much of their life with bad ha, it's very ironic that so much of my time is now spent attending lectures on disease and taking courses in pathology. i still struggle with my anxiety, but regularly see a therapist &amp; psychiatrist to keep things in check. 

my experience has led me to wonder if anyone else in this community has a biomedical/research/disease-related job? if so, i'd love to hear your stories. ",Anxiety,287

"like what the fuck i can't fucking do anything like a normal person. i got into a huge fight with my parents today because i can't take 4 college classes at once. realistically i can only take 2 because of my stupid high stress levels. my mom was telling me that when she's stressed she walks around her floor once. no mom, you being stressed out teaching sixth grade isn't the fucking same and i've heard plenty of anxiety coping strategies, you aren't going to fucking fix me by telling me to take a walk. and it super doesn't help when you tell me that ""i have a right to be upset."" no fucking shit you do but that doesn't mean that you get to overrride any feelings i have and tell me that i don't really understand my own emotions and that your life is so much harder than mine. everything ends up being about her feelings and how she has a right to feel stuff. no one is trying to take that from her, all i trying to fucking do is express what's wrong with me. when i fucking say that i'm dropping a few classes no matter what their input is, my mom immediately takes that and says ""obviously you don't care about me or my feelings!"" no mom that's fucking not what i said, i said i need to reduce my course load because of my fucking mental illness and i said that whatever your opinion on this one fucking thing is won't change the outcome. then she goes on about how i'm so selfish and never think about her and how my plan for life is shit and how i just need to do whatever she tells me to have a real life. fuck you and you trying to explain to me that i'm just getting in my own way and how i just need to commit to something and everything will be okay. you teaching sixth grade doesn't mean you know everything about what i'm going through. i'm so tired of her always thinking she knows exactely how to fix me and that it's so fucking easy to overcome this and ""just act like normal."" stupid fucking rant over.",Bipolar,375

"why can't i do just one thing? so, i've posted here before, but here we go again:

i work on hobbies, skills, and side hustles very intensely, but never intensely enough to do anything with them.  i have a degree in music education so i'm really really good at researching and breaking things down to the fundamental level in which i can learn them effectively.  i am capable of picking things up very quickly.  it's almost like the huge, dramatic improvements you make at the beginning of a skill or hobby give me the validation that i crave.

the problem comes when i hit a plateau in improvement.  these plateaus where you stop making huge dramatic improvements happen naturally.  due to my super sick avpd tendencies, this plateau is perceived as invalidation and rejection.  i'm aware of how ridiculous it is, but it continues to happen.  at this point i basically ghost the hobby and start with something old or new.  whether or not i retain the knowledge from my ""fixation"" is anyone's guess.

what should happen at these points of plateau is thoughtful consistency.  if you continue to chip away, those vast improvements will happen, but over a larger timespan.  i am unable to achieve that consistency because my avpd tendencies make it extremely difficult to get past the first plateau of any skill.

ideally, i wish i could just spend months and months, even years, fixating on doing just one thing so that i can actually see these trees bear fruit.

here are a few examples of what i mean:

\- contemporary/jazz saxophone/bass.  have the skills/knowledge in order to play and make a nice amount of cash gigging or playing weddings.  can't use these skills because i lack the consistency to go to jam sessions monthly, network, and learn the songs necessary to operate in these settings.  the intense social aspect of the jazz/contemporary music scene also triggers my avpd tendencies.

\-youtube/video editing/content creation - built a youtube channel, totally unrelated to music, from nothing to monetized in less than a year, with almost 100,000 views.  lots of potential for growth.  i taught myself and know my away around photoshop, premiere pro, after effects, with knowledge of basic filmmaking/editing techniques, audio engineering, etc.  again, i wish i could just completely no life this and make it blow up, cause i know i could.

\-programming/tech  i've taught myself, in a short time frame, a lot about programming, as well as the industry best practices and standards.  i know for a fact that if i could just do this every day consistently, i could turn it in to a career.

i wish i could just pick one of these things and go hard at it every single day.",Personality disorder,458

"i see an overarching theme here where people are deciding whether or not they want to stay or go. they often decide they want to go, but yet cannot bring themselves to do it. i also observe that many here are young, so i wanted to add another perspective. everyone is situation is different, and i am not here to recommend anything, but i can tell you, when it comes to living with depression, it does not get better with time. depression is a very selfish and self-centered disorder. we obsess over ourselves, how we have affected others, and how we feel. we also obsess over how the people we leave behind would feel with us being gone. we consider those who we have hurt in life, but we fail to consider this: the countless others we are going to hurt. when i think of all of the pain i could have spared people, it becomes overwhelming. the marriages i ruined, the relationships, the children i brought into the world. you think its painful to disappoint your parents? failing your children is a pain 100 times worse. exposing those who love you--whom you are supposed to protect--to the addiction, abuse, the emotional absence, and all of the other awful things that come along with depression is horrible. then, you find yourself in a place where you cannot leave, because you are a provider and you cannot devastate your children. its like being in one of those movies where going to hell is being damned to live the same day over and over. and all you have to look forward to is growing old, the loss of family members, the decline of your health, financial struggles, and career failures. yeah, things could get better. but if you are wired as badly as we are, this is highly unlikely. not only will things get worse for you, but you will ruin the lives of people you have yet to meet, some of whom have not yet been born. consider all of this as you decide whether you want to stay or go. maybe it will get better--probably it will not",Depression,358

"worried i have worms in my brains, among other bizarre health anxieties. for the past several months i've been on a huge parasite scare that came out of seemingly nowhere. i even had stool samples taken (again, several months ago) and everything came back negative. but now i'm thinking maybe the samples weren't great. apparently they do their testing kind of hastily sometimes, so i'm thinking of doing a second batch of samples.

anyway... i always thought that tapeworms were just an intestinal parasite. but then i read that they can spread to other organs too, including your eyes and brains. christ. so, naturally, i look in the mirror every day to make sure there aren't any worms in my eyes. i also check my stool with every bowel movement. and now i'm worried that the larvae of this hypothetical worm has spread to my lungs (i've been coughing a lot lately) and brains as well (would explain my headaches, and why i feel so spaced out.)

i've also had to take my cat to the vet a couple times because she was diagnosed with diabetes, so naturally i'm worried about fleas as well now. i just saw some kind of small, brown bug on my floor (one of my cats spotted it) that bounced around a couple times before i killed it. now, it could've just been a moth that was struggling to fly, but it could've also been a flea. right? and infected fleas carry feline tapeworms that are even worse than regular tapeworms if they spread to humans.

so yeah, it's 3 am and i'm going over all of this shit in my head, unable to sleep.

i guess i should mention i'm also worried about going blind, as my astigmatism has been getting worse (and i found out about something called keratoconus, which i may have) and i also have all kinds of pains in my body (around pancreas and liver, especially) so i could also have cancer. or maybe those are just the cysts formed by the larvae of the tapeworm.

and i do also worry about early-onset dementia and stuff like that, but that's kind of taken a backseat while 90% of my mental energy goes into worrying about worms.",Anxiety,376

"you may not see my depression but it is with me at all times. it is the pooling of tears in my eyes while i am driving, making it hard to see oncoming traffic. it is the secretive, yet frantic wiping away of tears when i breakdown and do not want my significant other to see me crying. it is the laying awake at night staring at the ceiling, revisiting memories that inflict hurt and pain, and not being able to stop. it is the stressing about the future, and then reassuring myself its alright by realising that by then i probably would have taken my own life and will not have to deal with it. it is the staring out into the distance thinking of ways to kill myself, and not hearing a word someone said while talking to me. it is the zoning back in after and realising that my suicidal thoughts, so frequent, can devour my mind entirely at any time. it is the realisation that i have been suffering for years on end and likely will continue to suffer for the rest of my life. it is shaking of my legs and the biting of my nails. it is losing interest in literally everything and not knowing how to spend my days. it is distracting myself as much as possible so my mind does not consume me. it is not explaining how i feel to anyone because it is so much i would never get it all out anyways. it is becoming attached to one person and being so dependent on them even when i try not to be, it is feeling lonely and trapped in my thoughts every time i am without them. it is wanting to be held every time i am sad because i am scared i will hurt myself. it is my awareness that my mind is the real problem, constantly putting these thoughts in my head, but not being able to prevent it. it is finally being willing to give up dreams and experiences like having children and buying my first house because i do not think i can live like this much longer. it is my worst fear. it is my depression. depression and i",Depression,375

i've experienced health anxiety on and off for most of my life. it has become a lot better over the years and i have found ways to cope and calm myself down. i'm not the ha-type that goes to doctors a lot - actually almost never - partly because my ""rational"" part knows that it's just ha and partly because it's so crazy expensive. my main tools for managing ha has been ""act normal"" (even if i feel worried and obsess, do not take action - don't look for reassurance, don't see a doctor, don't google - don't feed the monster), setting a specific time when it's ok to worry (""between 6-7 at night, worry time. at other times, just postpone it."") and writing down what i worry about. it's been going well for the last few years and i almost considered myself ""cured"".
until i decided to go for an extensive health check with a battery of tests. there's no particular symptom that brought on this, just that it's something i should start doing regularly at my age. what normal people do. however, as soon as i booked the test and got the list of tests, ha totally exploded. in a way worse than the usual ha where i used to focus on just a few illnesses - now i basically convinced that with that many tests and possible cancers, i must check positive for at least one! has anyone else experience this kind of setback and how did you cope? i still have two-three more weeks before the results.",Anxiety,269

"follow these tips to lower your depression and tiredness:1. do not drink more than one cup of coffee in a day under any circumstances. and that one cup drink it only in the morning...not at any other time of day. more than one cup increases depression. and drink one cup of tea in the evening if possible2. reduce screen brightness of phone and laptop?computer. and download f.lux for laptop/computer and twilight app for phone. these apps reduce blue light coming from screens. blue light affects sleep and makes us tired.3. go to sleep half hour early than you are doing now, and wake up half hour early.4. take b complex pills ( pills containing b vitamins), one a day for a week and one very alternate day after that for a month.5. and visit a therapist and a psychiatrist. take counselling and medication both. it works wonders.6. do not drink more than two sodas (softdrinks) a week. i give a shit about all of you. read these tips to lower your depression and increase your energy levels.",Depression,177

i've been a gamer for 30 years. when i was a kid we had much less to choose from so playing the same videogame over and over wasn't a problem... these days we have tens of thousands to choose from and i own well over 1000 of them. this is my only major hobby, by the way, which is a problem in and of itself. i used to wake up and immediately starting playing something to keep away the feeling of dread in my life because i suffer from depression and anxiety. games have been my only escape from that nightmare for many years. 

i'm finding now that i can't seem to find interest in them anymore. i have hundreds of games i've not even completed and i want to finish them but the motivation just isn't there. i will seriously stress myself out flipping through all of what i own trying to find one that catches my attention and nothing ever sticks out. i never had this issue 5 years ago but now i'll juat gwt frustrated, panic, and sit at home on my day off doing nothing because my one hobby seems useless to me now. i dont even know how to engage in other activities because i've been on the same pattern for so long. i really juat want to be able to focus and enjoy gaming again. 

this all sounds seriously dumb when i wrote it down, i almost don't want to post this because it feels that stupid but it genuinely makes me miserable. all i do is work and sit at home being bored and boredom is literally killing me. without the motivation to engage in activities i become consumed by stress and depression. what can i do to find the motivation again? i'm going to go in circles until i die.",Stress,339

do i have depression if i am scared to feel trapped in the feelings of being hopeless and helpless and i pour out all my emotions on my close ones and my boyfriend. like i have nervous breakdowns in front of them. because i am scared that if i do not say these feelings i will be trapped and they will eat me alive. but then afterwards i feel like a horrible burden. who do i talk to every time i feel like venting? i cannot just talk to my friends or boyfriend each time i am frustrated. people cannot handle or manage your problems like this. nor can i call up my therapist every day each time something stressful happens. does not knowing how to manage emotions a symptom of depression? if i do not allow myself to feel guilty for being a burden because i lie to myself but then later i feel guilty for a while. then i try to push those thoughts away to feel normal and lie to myself that venting is ok. do i have depression,Depression,182

"my father thinks i am a freak and wants me to kill myself.my mother is disappointed that i turned out like this.i get daily comments from my brother; shit like you will never be a man, its just a phase, you do not have a dick and balls do that means you are a girl, you are so dumb/delusional you think you are a guy etc etc. they are so ashamed of me that they refuse to let me come out to my extended family, they even wanted me to not tell my friend but of course i did not listen. i get misgendered and deadnamed daily, not just by my family but by people at school, i have already been threatened to be killed for being trans by some guy. i was lied to for so long, my parents told me that they would love me no matter who i become but its all a fucking lie because i am not the perfect cishet mentally stable daughter they wanted; instead they got a fucked up trans faggot son. i could of turned out to be some serial killer and they would of preferred that over me being trans. if my family want me to hurry up and die already they just need to say so; i know exactly where a train is and ill gladly sit down on the rail roads. i mean my father has already told me to go kill myself but ill listen to what he says if he tells me to kms again (or anyone else in my family says to). none of them bother to listen to me so at this point ill need to kill myself to prove that my gender dysphoria is real and that their words have consequences. ffs my mother tried to gaslight me into believing that i was not trans when i came out to her. i doubt ill make it to see 2022 and to be honest, i hope i do not; i am so sick of this shit. what tf did i do to deserve this kind of torture? why could not i just be born normal? i am cursed with gender dysphoria and an unsupportive family (ftm)",Suicidal,371

"involuntary med change the past year and a half i have tried several different med combos. lamictal and risperidone were sort of working but the risperidone had some very unfortunate side effects. my psydoc took me off the risperidone and put me in saphris last december. 
between the saphris and the lamictal i have been the most stable i have ever been.  

last week i went to refill my saphris, and out of nowhere my insurance no longer covers it. it was 2 months ago i got it filled! so instead of a $50 copay it's now $360.  
my psydoc prescribed me geodon in its place, but 

i'm so frustrated.  i dont want a new med. i liked what i was on.
now i get to play another round of what weird side effects am i going to get, and the possibility of it not working as well.

"my future feels so hopeless. i'm 28 years old, my resume is useless, haven't worked in 2 years, and i am very avoidant of the world hi there. i have been depressed since i was 12 years old. i am now 28. i also struggle with bpd, social anxiety and avoidant personality disorder, afraid to leave the house by myself, reliant on my 66 year old mother to pay my medical insurance, and my husband is working full time barely keeping us afloat. i have tried and tried to work. several different fields. even part time. it always ended up in burn out and felt more depressed and anxious so i had to quit. i am worried, i feel my future is really hopeless. i love my husband so much. we wanted to have a family and it's feeling like that won't happen because of my mental health and the low money thing. i am afraid he will abandon me because of all this though deep down really don't feel like he will because he has been here through everything.

i know that is so much. that is definitely something to be grateful for. but we fight a good bit because we're both so stressed out.

nothing really brings me happiness except substances, (and that leads to bad feelings when it wears off or sometimes when on them) and i've been mostly sober for a year.

i see a therapist. i take medications. i just... i am not content in life. i am constantly worried about everything. i constantly feel like i'm worthless and my husband deserves someone more stable that he doesn't essentially have to be a caregiver to at times. i stay in bed about 70% of my days because i feel like things are so hard to do and feel so pointless.

i don't have many friends and live in a small town, so there aren't any meetup groups or anything. and since i don't work and am not in school, no opportunities to make many friends. i do have one so i can try to branch out with her friends maybe. it feels like life is just about working. and i feel so depressed by the state of everything, and by my worries that things won't improve in the future.

things don't get better. not if you don't work for them. and i have worked, i've tried so many treatments, but the one thing i rarely do is go out in the world.

"doing very well, but i feel guilty about recent events. any advice? hi everyone,

so i've been kicking life in the butt recently and i'm doing really well at work. i'm so proud of myself and i know that i have the energy to keep going and even push bad thoughts away.

to put the situation into context, when i was first diagnosed with bpd i took a lot of time off work sick. i then decided to leave and help myself get better. i rejoined my job back in feb and i think i surprised myself in thriving when i went back.

so i work in a call centre and if you know what its like working in one, you'll know that diseases and sickness are a minefield. on sunday night i came down with really bad flu and took monday off. my team leader was fine with it as they know that this is something that's going round and tbf i sounded awful on the phone. i've also decided to take today off too as i'm not feeling much better. 

i guess i'm feeling pretty guilty about it because i've never had an absence from work since i went back. i'm feeling a little paranoid and worried that my tl might think i'm slipping back into old bad habits of staying of work. i know this is pretty trivial but it means a lot to me that i've improved so much.

just wondering if anyone had any advice about feeling a little less guilty about it?",Bipolar,258
"just got prescribed enlift, xanax as well as magnesium for my anxiety. do you guys have any insight on what to expect? personal experiences? hello! after dreading going to a psychiatrist for a couple of months i finally got the courage to do it and this is a big step for me. 

the doctor prescribed me enlift , xanax and magnesium (which i've heard good things about it in this subreddit). ive only ever been prescribed zoloft, tried it for about 3 months and it didn't work for me so i'm basically going in blind. 

the doctor told me some basic instructions as well as explained how they work but it doesn't ease my anxiety about them, especially xanax. (i generally get a lot of anxiety about medications tho not just this kind) . i know medications like these aren't a one-size-fits-all but i think it would ease my anxiety to know some of your guys personal experiences with them. i think knowing i'm not alone in this will make it less scary for me, especially with the stigma in my country around any medication for mental health.
